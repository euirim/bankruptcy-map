Attach a copy of the certificate and the payment      plan, if any, that you developed with the agency.     I received a briefing from an approved credit           counseling agency within the 180 days before I      filed this bankruptcy petition, but I do not have a      certificate of completion.      Within 14 days after you file this bankruptcy petition,      you MUST file a copy of the certificate and payment      plan, if any.     I certify that I asked for credit counseling      services from an approved agency, but was      unable to obtain those services during the 7      days after I made my request, and exigent      circumstances merit a 30-day temporary waiver      of the requirement.       To ask for a 30-day temporary waiver of the           requirement, attach a separate sheet explaining      what efforts you made to obtain the briefing, why      you were unable to obtain it before you filed for      bankruptcy, and what exigent circumstances      required you to file this case.     Your case may be dismissed if the court is           dissatisfied with your reasons for not receiving a      briefing before you filed for bankruptcy.

I am not required to receive a briefing about          credit counseling because of:Incapacity.    I have a mental illness or a mental        deficiency that makes me        incapable of realizing or making        rational decisions about finances.  Disability.

If two married people are filing together, both are equally responsible for supplying correct information. Using the property you listed on Schedule A/B: Property (Official Form 106A/B) as your source, list the property that you claim as exempt. If more space is needed, fill out and attach to this page as many copies of Part 2: Additional Page as necessary. On the top of any additional pages, write your name and case number (if known).For each item of property you claim as exempt, you must specify the amount of the exemption you claim. One way of doing so is to state a specific dollar amount as exempt. Alternatively, you may claim the full fair market value of the property being exempted up to the amount of any applicable statutory limit. Some exemptions-such as those for health aids, rights to receive certain benefits, and tax-exempt retirement funds-may be unlimited in dollar amount. However, if you claim an exemption of 100% of fair market value under a law that limits the exemption to a particular dollar amount and the value of the property is determined to exceed that amount, your exemption would be limited to the applicable statutory amount.1.  Which set of exemptions are you claiming? Check one only, even if your spouse is filing with you.  You are claiming state and federal nonbankruptcy exemptions. 11 U.S.C. § 522(b)(3)    You are claiming federal exemptions. 11 U.S.C. § 522(b)(2)2.

A trustee may have the right to take possession of and sell the remaining property that is not exempt and use the sale proceeds to pay your creditors.The purpose of filing a chapter 7 case is to obtain a discharge of your existing debts. If, however, you arefound to have committed certain kinds of improper conduct described in the Bankruptcy Code, the court may deny your  discharge and, if it does, the purpose for which you filed the bankruptcy petition will be defeated.Even if you receive a general discharge, some particular debts are not discharged under the law. Therefore, you may still be responsible for most taxes and student loans; debts incurred to pay nondischargeable taxes; domestic support and property settlement obligations; most fines, penalties, forfeitures, and criminal restitution obligations; certain debts which are not properly listed in your bankruptcy papers; and debts for death or personal injury caused by operating a motor vehicle, vessel, or aircraft while intoxicated from alcohol or drugs.  Also, if a creditor can prove that a debt arose from fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, or theft, or from a willful and malicious injury, the bankruptcy court may determine that the debt is not discharged.Chapter 13:  Repayment of All or Part of the Debts of an Individual with Regular Income ($235 filingfee, $75 administrative fee: Total fee $310)Chapter 13 is designed for individuals with regular income who would like to pay all or part of their debts in installments over a period of time.  You are only eligible for chapter 13 if your debts do not exceed certain dollar amounts set forth in the Bankruptcy Code.Under chapter 13, you must file with the court a plan to repay your creditors all or part of the money that you owe them, using your future earnings.  The period allowed by the court to repay your debts may be three years or five years, depending upon your income and other factors.  The court must approve your plan before it can take effect.After completing the payments under your plan, your debts are generally discharged except for domestic support obligations; most student loans; certain taxes; most criminal fines and restitution obligations; certain debts which are not properly listed in your bankruptcy papers; certain debts for acts that caused death or personal injury; and certain long term secured obligations.Chapter 11:  Reorganization ($1,167 filing fee, $550 administrative fee: Total fee $1,717)Chapter 11 is designed for the reorganization of a business but is also available to consumer debtors. Its provisions are quite complicated, and any decision by an individual to file a chapter 11 petition should be reviewed with an attorney.Chapter 12:  Family Farmer or Fisherman ($200 filing fee, $75 administrative fee: Total fee $275)Chapter 12 is designed to permit family farmers and fishermen to repay their debts over a period of time fromfuture earnings and is similar to chapter 13. The eligibility requirements are restrictive, limiting its use to those whose income arises primarily from a family-owned farm or commercial fishing operation.3. Bankruptcy Crimes and Availability of Bankruptcy Papers to Law Enforcement OfficialsA person who knowingly and fraudulently conceals assets or makes a false oath or statement under penaltyof perjury, either orally or in writing, in connection with a bankruptcy case is subject to a fine, imprisonment, or both.  All information supplied by a debtor in connection with a bankruptcy case is subject to examination by the Attorney General acting through the Office of the United States Trustee, the Office of the United States Attorney, and other components and employees of the Department of Justice.WARNING: Section 521(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code requires that you promptly file detailed information regarding your creditors, assets, liabilities, income, expenses and general financial condition. Your bankruptcy case may be dismissed if this information is not filed with the court within the time deadlines set by the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules, and the local rules of the court.

Proc. No. 13-52443(KG))STYRON LLC))Defendant.)Re Dkt No. 19 & 25_______________________________________)MEMORANDUM OPINIONThe Court has before it cross-motions for partial summary judgment in this interestingadversary proceeding.  Pirinate Consulting Group, LLC, as Liquidation Trustee of the NPCreditor Liquidation Trust (the ﬁTrusteeﬂ), has brought suit against Styron LLC (ﬁStyronﬂ),to avoid and recover $11,788,000.85 in transfers which debtors NewPage Corporation andNewPage Wisconsin Systems Inc. (together, ﬁDebtorsﬂ) made to Styron during the ninetydays immediately prior to Debtors™ bankruptcy filing, i.e., June 9 through September 6, 2011(the ﬁPreference Period)1.  Debtors filed for bankruptcy on September 7, 2011 (the ﬁPetition1  The Court is addressing only that portion of the claim which the partial summary judgmentcross-motions entail, namely, the post-petition draw on the letter of credit, discussed infra.Case 13-52443-KG    Doc 34    Filed 10/01/14    Page 1 of 14 Dateﬂ).  The parties™ basic contentions are these: (1) Styron argues that it is entitled to useas part of its new value defense all unpaid invoices as of the Petition Date and which werepaid post-petition when Styron drew on a letter of credit at a third-party bank; (2) the Trusteecontends that as a creditor that drew on a collateralized letter of credit to satisfy invoices,Styron is not entitled to an ﬁunpaid new valueﬂ credit because it did not enrich Debtors™estate.FactsStyron and Debtors began doing business together in June 2010, when Styronpurchased a division of Dow Chemical that had been selling chemicals and related materialto Debtors.  Styron continued such sales.  Affidavit of Michael Loughery, ¶ 7 (ﬁLougheryAff.ﬂ) (D.I. 19, Attachment 2) (Senior Financial Analyst of Styron).Styron became a beneficiary on September 15, 2010, to a letter of credit (the ﬁLOCﬂ)which was originally issued to Debtors on July 20, 2009.  Id., ¶ 10.  At that time, Debtorsposted the LOC for the benefit of Dow Chemical in the amount of $2 million.  Later, Debtorssubstituted Styron for Dow Chemical as beneficiary and increased the LOC to $3 million. Id., Ex. 2.The LOC, according to Debtors, was issued pursuant to the Revolving Credit andGuaranty Credit Agreement, dated December 21, 2011, for which Debtors were borrowers. Debtors had $101 million in letters of credit issued but not drawn as of June 30, 2011. Declaration of George F. Martin in Support of Debtors™ First Day Motions and Applications,¶ 9 (ﬁFirst Day Decl.ﬂ) (D.I. 3, Chapter 11 Case).2Case 13-52443-KG    Doc 34    Filed 10/01/14    Page 2 of 14 Wachovia Bank, N.A.2, was an issuing bank for letters of credit.  Debtors granted afirst priority lien on all cash, receivables, inventory and the like to secure their obligations. Debtors were required to reimburse amounts drawn on letters of credit.  The letters of credit,including the LOC, were fully collateralized.  When Wells Fargo honored a draw on theLOC, and other letters of credit, it immediately notified Debtors who then reimbursed WellsFargo.  The procedure for a Styron draw required Styron to present a statement, ﬁinvoice(s)have not been paid and are past due.  We therefore demand payment in the amount of (insertamount) as same is due and owing.ﬂ The LOC terms limited draws to past due invoices. Loughery Aff., ¶ 11.From April 2010 to August 26, 2011, Debtors paid Styron™s invoices on an averageof fourteen days after Styron issued an invoice.  On August 26, 2011, Styron changed thepayment terms to require cash in advance because Styron was worried about Debtors™ creditposition.  Email from Michael Loughery, dated August 26, 2011.  Debtors and Styron agreedto reduce the $3 million LOC by $200,000.  Email from Timothy Musbaum to Styron, datedAugust 28, 2011.2  Wachovia Bank, N.A., merged with and into Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.

Jurisdiction and Venue3This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this adversary proceeding, which arisesunder title 11 of the United States Code and arises in and relates to the Chapter 11 Cases commenced in the Court.  The statutory predicates for the relief sought herein are sections502, 547, and 550 of the Bankruptcy Code and Rules 3007 and 7001 of the Federal Rules ofBankruptcy Procedure.The adversary proceeding is a core proceeding to be heard and determined by theCourt pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 157(b), and the Court may enter final orders for matterscontained herein.  Venue is proper in the District of Delaware pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1408and 1409.B.  Standards for Summary JudgmentPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a), made applicable to this adversaryproceeding through Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7056, a court may grant summaryjudgment where ﬁthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant isentitled to judgment as a matter of law.ﬂ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  A material fact is onethatﬂmight affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.ﬂ  Anderson v. Liberty3  Styron explains in its motion papers that because it never filed a proof of claim in Debtors™cases, Styron is entitled to a jury trial and has until October 31, 2014, to withdraw the reference. Styron further explains, and the Court concurs, that the Court retains jurisdiction for the pretrialmatters, including disposition motions, and that such a ruling does not deprive Styron of its jury trialright.  The issue is academic at this time, however, because Styron is a movant and has not yetrequested a ruling on the jury trial issue.5Case 13-52443-KG    Doc 34    Filed 10/01/14    Page 5 of 14 Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  A dispute regarding a material fact is genuine ﬁwherereasonable minds could disagree on the result.ﬂ  Delta Mills, Inc. v. GMAC Comm. Fin., Inc.(In re Delta Mills, Inc.), 404 B.R. 95, 105 (Bankr. D. Del. 2009).  The moving party bearsthe burden of demonstrating an entitlement to summary judgement. McAnaney v. AstoriaFin. Corp., 665 F. Supp. 2d 132, 141 (E.D.N.Y. 2009).At the summary judgment stage, a court™s function is not to weigh the evidence anddetermine the truth of the matter, but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S., 317, 322 (1986); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  Inmaking this determination, a court must view all facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant and must draw all reasonable inferences from the underlying facts in favor of thenon-movant.  McAnaney, 665 F. Supp. 2d at 141; Pastore v. Bell Tel. Co. of Pa., 24 F.3d508, 512 (3d Cir. 1994).  Any doubt must also be construed in the non-moving party™s favor. Delta Mills, 404 B.R. at 105.Once the moving party provides sufficient evidence, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to rebut the evidence.  Delta Mills, 404 B.R. at 105.  The non-moving partyﬁmust do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the materialfacts.ﬂ  McAnaney, 665 F. Supp. 2d at 141 (quoting Caldarola v. Calabrese, 298 F.2d 156,160 (2d Cir. 2002)).  ﬁ[T]he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between thepartiesﬂ cannot defeat a properly supported summary judgment motion.  Anderson, 477 U.S.at 247-48.  The dispute must relate to a genuine issue of material fact.  Delta Mills, 404 B.R.at 105.  Thus, a non-moving party cannot defeat a summary judgment motion based on6Case 13-52443-KG    Doc 34    Filed 10/01/14    Page 6 of 14 conclusory allegations and denials, but instead must provide supportive arguments or factsthat show the necessity of a trial.  McAnaney, 665 F. Supp. 2d at 141.  Summary judgmentshould be granted if, after drawing all reasonable inferences from the underlying facts in thelight most favorable to the non-moving party, the court concludes that there is no genuineissue of material fact to be resolved at trial and the moving party is entitled to judgment asa matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).The standards governing summary judgment apply to cross-motions.  Williams v.Philadelphia Hous. Auth., 834 F.Supp. 794, 797 (E.D.Pa. 1993).  The Court must review themotions independently.  Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. Utilicorp United, 928 F.Supp.466, 470 (D.Del. 1996).  Cross-motions may seem to represent that the parties agree thatthere are no material issues of facts, but the Court is neither bound to ﬁthe implicitagreementﬂ nor required to enter judgment for either party.ﬂ  Enron Corp. v. Whalen (In reEnron Corp.), 351 B.R. 305, 310 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2006).C.  MeritsA ﬁpreferenceﬂ is a transfer to a creditor which a debtor makes immediately prior toa bankruptcy whereby the creditor receives payment in full and other creditors have no suchassurance.  Friedman™s Inc. v. Roth Staffing Companies, L.P. (In re Friedman™s Inc.), Adv.No. 09-10161, 2011 WL 5975283, *2 (Bankr. D. Del. Nov. 30, 2011), aff™d sub nom. Friedman™s Liquidating Trust v. Roth Staffing Companies, L.P., 738 F.3d 547 (3d Cir. 2013).The six requirements that the Trustee must establish to make a preference voidableare: (1) a transfer is made; (2) on account of antecedent debt; (3) to or for the benefit of the7Case 13-52443-KG    Doc 34    Filed 10/01/14    Page 7 of 14 creditor; (4) while the debtor was insolvent; (5) within 90 days of the filing of the petition;(6) that left the creditor better off than it would have been if the transfer had not been madeand it had asserted its claim in a chapter 7 liquidation.  11 U.S.C. § 547(b).A defense to a preference claim is for ﬁsubsequent new valueﬂ which limits oreliminates liability under Section 547(b).  Pursuant to Section 547(c)(4)(B).[t]he trustee may not avoid under this section a transfer. . .to orfor the benefit of a creditor, to the extent that, after such transfer,such creditor gave new value to or for the benefit of the debtor.. . on account of which new value the debtor did not make anotherwise unavoidable transfer to or for the benefit of suchcreditor.11 U.S.C. § 547(c)(4)(B).  ﬁNew Valueﬂ is defined under section 547(a)(2) as ﬁmoney ormoney™s worth in goods, services, or new credit. . . that is neither void nor voidable by thedebtor or the trustee under any applicable law.ﬂ  11 U.S.C. § 547(a).There are important policy considerations for the subsequent new value defense.  Itencourages creditors to continue to help a troubled business; and, it prevents or limits thetrustee from avoiding all transfers during the preference period where a creditor hasbenefitted the debtor and, consequently, its other creditors.  See, e.g., Friedman™s, 2011 WL5975283 at *2.  To qualify for the defense, the transfer must not have harmed the debtor™sestate.  A transfer which meets the delineated requirements, namely, it was made in exchangefor new value and the transfer adds value to the estate in an amount equal to the transfer,means the debtor™s estate suffers no diminution.  In such circumstance, the debtor™s estatesuffers no injury.8Case 13-52443-KG    Doc 34    Filed 10/01/14    Page 8 of 14 Styron argues that it is entitled to the new value defense for all invoices unpaid as ofthe Petition Period and subsequently paid post petition when Styron drew on the LOC. Styron reasons that: (a) it provided goods on an unsecured basis, (b) the transfers in questionoccurred before Styron shipped the goods covered in the invoices, and (c) the LOC was notproperty of Debtors™ estate.  It is fair to say that Styron relies principally on a recent decisionof the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, viz., Friedman™s Liquidating Trust v. Roth StaffingCompanies LP, 738 F.3d 547 (3d Cir. 2013).  Debtor, Friedman™s, issued payments to Rothtotaling $82,000 during the preference period.  Following the bankruptcy filing, the Courtentered a wage order on debtor™s motion and Friedman™s paid Roth $72,412.71 on accountof prepetition staffing services (Roth provided Friedman™s with its staff).  The liquidatingtrustee made a preference claim for other prepetion payments (totaling $81,997.57), and Rothasserted a subsequent new value defense, claiming that it provided new value ($100,660.88)which exceeded the preference claim.  The liquidating trustee, in turn, argued that Roth couldnot use the post-petition payment ($72,412.71) it received pursuant to the wage order.  TheThird Circuit did not agree with Freidman™s and held that the post-petition payment did notnegate the new value defense.The Third Circuit discussed and compared cases arriving at contrary conclusions. After discussing the statutory rules of construction and the statutory scheme of preferenceclaims, the Third Circuit turned to policy considerations.  The policy considerations, quotingfrom Union Bank v. Wolas, 502 U.S. 151, 161 (1991) (in turn, quoting from H.R. Rep. No.95-595, at 177-178), are:9Case 13-52443-KG    Doc 34    Filed 10/01/14    Page 9 of 14 First, by permitting the trustee to avoid pre-bankruptcy transfersthat occur within a short period before bankruptcy, creditors arediscouraged from racing to the courthouse to dismember thedebtor during his slide into bankruptcy.  The protection thusafforded the debtor often enables him to work his way out of adifficult financial situation through cooperation with all of hiscreditors. Second, and more important, the preference provisionsfacilitate the prime bankruptcy policy of equality of distributionamong creditors of the debtor.The Third Circuit concluded that (1) replenishment of a debtor can occur even when a post-petition payment is for new value the creditor provided pre-petition (2) there must be a cut-off of the preference analysis at the petition date, and (3) this cut-off does not impair equaltreatment of all creditors because at such time all matters are under a bankruptcy court™ssupervision, at which point the debtor is under the scrutiny of the court, creditors, acommittee and the United States Trustee.  Friedman™s, 738 F.3d at 560-61.In response, the Trustee distinguishes Friedman™s in several respects;(1) Roth did not change the terms of the engagement pre-petition.(2) Friedman™s made the post-petition payment to Roth pursuant to a court order, i.e.,the wage order.(3) The Third Circuit distinguished post-petition payments made on a critical vendormotion from payments made on account of a reclamation claim.  The difference arises fromthe policy of not rewarding the ﬁrace of diligence.ﬂ(4) Styron did not seek the Court™s authority to draw on the LOC, in contrast to thewage order in Friedman™s.10Case 13-52443-KG    Doc 34    Filed 10/01/14    Page 10 of 14 It is important, as well, to discuss, in the context of policy, the Third Circuit™sdiscussion in Friedman™s of its decision in Kimmelman v. Port Auth. Of New York & NewJersey (In re Kiwi Int™l Air Lines, Inc.), 344 F.3d 311 (3d Cir. 2003).  Although the Courtrecognized Kiwi Air was not directly applicable to Friedman™s, id. at 562, the Third Circuitexplained as follows:In Kiwi Air, we held that the post-petition assumption of anexecutory contract under § 365 and a stipulated order pursuantto § 1110, which both require a trustee to cure certain defaults,preclude a trustee from bringing a preference action to recoverpre-petition payments made pursuant to the contract. . . . Ifanything, Kiwi Air teaches that post-petition events can cast thepayment in a different light in order to effectuate the purposesand provisions of the Code.Kiwi Air demonstrates that there are unique circumstances inwhich other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code dealing withpost-petition transactions directly interact with § 547 and thuscan alter the otherwise straightforward preference analysis.Friedman™s, 738 F.3d at 562.The law is thus clear that the bankruptcy filing fixed the preference analysis as of thePetition Date.  It is equally clear that under normal circumstances, a letter of credit is notproperty of a debtor™s estate.  See, e.g., Kellogg v. Blue Quail Energy Corp. (Matter ofCompton Corp.), 831 F.2d 586, 589 (5th Cir. 1987), reh™g granted, 835 F.2d 584 (1988),which the Third Circuit cited in its decision in Int™l Finance Corp. v. Kaiser Group Int™l, Inc.,399 F.3d 558 (3d Cir. 2005), which again held that letters of credit are not property of adebtor™s estate.  The Compton decision, however, goes beyond that simple explication of thelaw.11Case 13-52443-KG    Doc 34    Filed 10/01/14    Page 11 of 14 In explaining the ﬁwell establishedﬂ rule of bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit inCompton stated that an issuer honoring a draft on a letter of credit does so from its ownassets, not those of the customer, and, as a result, a trustee cannot enjoin post-petitionpayments from the letter of credit. Compton, 831 F.2d at 589. The Fifth Circuit furtherexplained that the independence principle of credit law renders any disputes between thebeneficiary and customer separate from the issuer™s obligation to pay the beneficiary.Compton, 831 F.2d at 590. However, the Fifth Circuit further reasoned that ﬁthe letter ofcredit itself and the payments thereunder may not be property of the debtor, but the collateralpledged as a security interest for the letter of credit is.ﬂ Compton, 831 F.2d at 590-91. TheFifth Circuit also noted that ﬁit is not necessary that the transfer be made directly to thecreditor– [if] the effect of which is to enable one of his creditors to obtain a greaterpercentage of his debt than another creditor of the same class, circuity of arrangement willnot avail to save it.ﬂ Compton, 831 F.2d at 591 (quoting Nat™l Bank of Newport v. Nat™lHerkimer County Bank, 225 U.S. 178, 184 (1912)).  The Compton court summarized itsruling as follows:  The precise holding in this case needs to be emphasized.  We donot hold that payments under a letter of credit, or even a letter ofcredit itself, constitute preferential transfers under 11 U.S.C. §547(b) or property under U.S.C. § 541.  The holding of this casefully allows the letter of credit to function.  We preserve itssanctity and the underlying independence doctrine.  We do not,however, allow an unsecured creditor to avoid a preferenceattack by utilizing a letter of credit to secure payment of anantecedent debt.  Otherwise the unsecured creditor wouldreceive an indirect preferential transfer from the granting of thesecurity for the letter of credit to extent of the value of that12Case 13-52443-KG    Doc 34    Filed 10/01/14    Page 12 of 14 security.  Our holding does not affect the strength of or theproper use of letters of credit.  When a letter of credit is issuedcontemporaneously with a new extension of credit, the creditorbeneficiary will not be subject to a preferential attack under thedirect/indirect doctrine elaborated in this case because thecreditor will have given new value in exchange for the indirectbenefit of the secured letter of credit.  Only when a creditorreceives a secured letter of credit to cover an unsecuredantecedent debt will it be subject to a preferential attack under11 U.S.C. § 547(b).Id., 831 F.2d at 594.Here, the parties do not dispute any material facts. Styron either admits the truth ofthe allegation in the Complaint that the LOC was secured, or assumes the truth for purposesof the pending cross-motions.  However, neither party can show that, as a matter of law, itis entitled to partial summary judgment on the new value defense. Following the ThirdCircuit™s decision in Friedman™s, it is clear that a court-authorized post-petition payment bythe debtor does not affect a creditor™s new value defense. However, it is not clear whetherthe same protection is available to a creditor who, on its own volition, takes action to drawon a letter of credit that, ultimately, has the effect of depleting property of the estate. It is likewise clear that a letter of credit, itself, is not property of the estate. However,it is often secured by property that does belong to the estate. The case law is not settled asto the interaction between Section 547(c)(4)(A) and an indirect security interest, particularlyon these facts, where the draw on the letter of credit almost immediately reduced the valueof the property of the estate by triggering the nearly immediate repayment of the draw andassociated fees. The Supreme Court has already cautioned against this type of indirectarrangement which has the effect of a creditor™s recovery greater than other similarly situated13Case 13-52443-KG    Doc 34    Filed 10/01/14    Page 13 of 14 creditors.Further, on the facts there appears to be a disputed and potentially material issue offact.  Did Styron receive payment based upon more onerous payment terms despite theparties™ long standing relationship?  According to the Trustee on August 26, 2011, during thePreference Period, Styron reduced the time for payment from 14 days to cash in advance. If so, does the Styron™s ﬁdiligenceﬂ negate the policy reasons for allowing the new valuedefense?  See Union Bank, 502 U.S. at 161.  The Court is also mindful of the Kiwi Airsuggestion that the preference analysis might be altered by ﬁunique circumstances.ﬂ Friedman™s, 738 F.3d at 562.  It remains to be determined whether Styron™s conduct Œ thechanging of payment terms and the post-petition draw on the LOC Œ bar the new valuedefense which Styron asserts.  The Court must deny the cross-motions for further development of the facts andcorresponding legal arguments.  First, it is unclear to the Court whether Styron did imposenew payment terms, and the legal effect of any such changes.  Second, because the LOC wassecured and the draws diminished the estate, was Styron obligated to seek the Court™sapproval for the post-petition draws?  Third, despite Styron™s concession for purposes of itsmotion, the Court wants to determine for itself whether the LOC was secured. Accordingly,the Court will deny both motions.

A trustee may have the  right to take possession of and sell the remaining property that is not exempt and use the sale proceeds to pay your creditors.The purpose of filing a chapter 7 case is to obtain a discharge of your existing debts . If, however, you arefound to have committed certain kinds of improper conduct described in the Bankruptcy Code, the court may deny your  discharge and , if it does, the purpose for which you filed the bankruptcy petition will be defeated.Even if you receive a general discharge , some particular debts are not discharged under the law .

The period allowed by the court to repay your debts may be three years or five years, depending upon your income and other factors.  The court must approve your plan before it can take effect .After completing the payments under your plan, your debts are generally discharged except for domestic support  obligations; most student loans; certain taxes; most criminal fines and restitution obligations; certain debts which are not properly listed in your bankruptcy papers; certain debts for acts that caused death or personal injury; and certain long term secured obligations.Chapter 11 :  Reorganization ($1000 filing fee, $46 administrative fee: Total fee  $1046)Chapter 11 is designed for the reorganization of a business but is also available to consumer debtors . Its provisions are quite complicated, and any decision by an individual to file a chapter 11  petition should be reviewed with an attorney.Chapter  12:  Family Farmer or Fisherman  ($200 filing fee, $46 administrative fee: Total fee  $246)Chapter 12 is designed to permit family farmers and fishermen to repay their debts over a period of time fromfuture earnings and is similar to chapter 13.

Kenneth Still, Trustee  Jerrold D. Farinash, Kennedy, Koontz  & Fa rinash, Chattanooga, Tennessee, Attorney for C. Kenneth Still, Trustee  Martin J. Levitt, Levitt and Levitt, Cha ttanooga, Tennessee, Attorney for Barbara S.  Arthur The Honorable Shelley D. Rucker United States Bankruptcy Court MEMORANDUM   The United States Trustee (ﬁUSTﬂ) and the  Chapter 13 Trustee (ﬁTrusteeﬂ) filed Motions to Examine Fees Paid to Attorney Barbara Si ms Arthur pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 329(b) and  Request for Sanctions in the chapter 13 cases filed on behalf of Jayson Smith and Elnor  Henderson1  (ﬁSmith Sanctions Motionﬂ and ﬁHende rson Sanctions Motion,ﬂ collectively the  ﬁSanctions Motionsﬂ).  Mr. Smith and Ms. Henderson approached Ms. Ar thur about filing a bankruptcy at a time  when Ms. Arthur was awaiting automatic reinstatem ent to practice in the United States District  Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee (ﬁDistrict Courtﬂ).  She had been suspended from  practice before the District Court because sh e had been suspended by the Tennessee Supreme  Court.  As a result of her suspension from practic e in the District Court, she lost her ability to  practice in the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee (ﬁBankruptcy Courtﬂ) and lost her electronic filing privileges.  Despite her inability to fi le documents or to appear in                                                   1 The two motions were tried at the same hearing although  separate exhibits were provided for each debtor. For ease  of reference the court will refer to exhi bits filed in Case No. 12-11603 related to the Sanctions Motions filed in that  case as ﬁSmith Exhibit #ﬂ and to exhibits filed in Case  No. 12-11857 related to the Sanctions Motion filed in that  case as ﬁHenderson Exhibit #.ﬂ   Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 2 of 44 3  Bankruptcy Court, she undertook to represent these debtors. She explained to the debtors that she could not file their pleadings electronically and offered as a solution to her filing problem that  they could execute the filings as pro se debtors. Both debtors signed petitions which stated that they were not represented by counsel. Ms. Arthur™s office filed the pleadings. Shortly thereafter she was readmitted to practice before the District  Court and regained her Bankruptcy Court filing  privileges. She filed a notice of appearance disc losing her representation. By the time the first  meeting of creditors was held, she was able to  appear on their behalf as counsel of record. Arguments of the Parties  The parties have very different views of th e appropriateness of this conduct. Ms. Arthur contends the following. She fully complied with her six month suspension. She was authorized to  practice law when she advised these two indivi duals about bankruptcy and assisted them in  preparing their petitions and schedules. She assumed her filing privileges would be reinstated  when the term of her suspension ended. Although her assumption concerning reinstatement was  incorrect, her assumption was an innocent mistake  regarding the process for regaining her filing  privileges. In response to the UST™s and Trustee™s motions, her brief, and in her hearing  testimony, she continues to question whether she ha d to be reinstated given the language of the District Court order of suspension and the use of the term ﬁautomaticallyﬂ in the District Court™s  local rule regarding reinstatement. Neverthele ss, upon learning of her mistake, she took the  necessary steps to comply w ith the local rule regarding reinstatement. Based upon her  understanding about the automatic reinstatement requirements, and because she contends she   needed to help the debtors as quickly as possible, she limited the scope of her employment  specifically to avoid running afoul of the District Court™s order. Since she could not appear of record to file the petitions, she  instructed the debtors to proceed pro se. The scope of her Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 3 of 44 4  employment included everything  except using the electronic case filing system (ﬁECFﬂ) and  presumably appearing in court before she was rein stated. Therefore, the debtors™ statements in  their petitions that they were not represente d by counsel for filing were accurate. Such a limitation on the scope of representation is  allowed by Rule 1.2 of the Tennessee Rules of Professional Conduct and there is no ethical rule against her not disclosing her involvement  unless that concealment also involves a viola tion of some other duty such as ﬁcompetence,  diligence, loyalty, communication,  confidentialityﬂ or ﬁconflicts of interest.ﬂ Smith, 12-11603,  Trial Brief of Barbara Arthur at 12 [Doc. No. 102]; Henderson, 12-11857, Trial Brief of Barbara Arthur at 12 [Doc. No. 90].  In addition, she co mmitted no fraud or dishonesty with regard to any  fact that was material to the bankruptcy pro ceeding. After filing, neither she nor the debtors  misled the court.  As soon as she was reinstat ed, she filed notices of appearance disclosing her involvement and appeared at the meetings of cr editors. There was no hearing at which the court was misled by the debtors™ repres entations on their petitions that they were not represented by an attorney.  Finally, the debtors suffered no harm by this approach to her filing problem.    In sharp contrast to Ms. Arthur™s character ization of the events, the UST contends Ms.  Arthur misled the court in violation of her  ethical obligations. According to the UST, Ms. Arthur™s actions constituted the practice of law before the court in violation of the local rules.   Ms. Arthur used the debtors to cover her misconduct. Ms. Art hur should disgorge her fees (which she has agreed to do).  She should be sanctioned pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 105 which gives the court authority to discipline an attorney who appears before the court for an intentional misrepresentation to the court.   She shoul d be suspended from practice because she has  displayed a pattern of ignoring her obligations to maintain he r good standing in the bar and she continues to practice law without  being admitted to do so.     Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 4 of 44 5   The Chapter 13 trustee contends that Ms. Art hur™s instructions to her clients that they sign their petitions to reflect that they were not represented by counsel was part of a ﬁschemeﬂ to  avoid the consequences of her suspension and was an effort to defraud the court. The scheme  required her to conspire with her clients to commit what he te rms as fraud that could have  resulted in the loss of their di scharge for making a false oath. He also seeks to have her held  accountable under Rule 9011 as having made a false re presentation to the court. He admits that  she did not sign the petitions as attorney of record; nevertheless, she should be held accountable as the author of the petitions and she presented them to be filed w ith the intent to appear in the  cases as soon as she was cleared by the District Court to do so. He also seeks her suspension. He  argues that her defense that no harm resu lted from her having her clients file pro se is irrelevant to the issue of whether an ethical violation occurred.      After consideration of the part ies™ arguments, the evidence presented at trial, the record in  the chapter 13 proceedings, and the  applicable law, the court has  reached the following decision.   First, the court finds that ethical violations occurred. Although the court finds a limitation of  representation does not per se violate Ms. Arthur™s professional obligations, the manner in which  she attempted to limit her representation did result  in an ethical violation.  First, her limitation  was ineffective. Second, she did not obtain her clients™ informed consent to such a limitation.  Third, and most importantly, the  court finds that the limited re presentation as Ms. Arthur has portrayed it was not reasonable under the circumstances of these two cases.  Second, the court finds that the nondisclosure of an attorney™s par ticipation is a breach of  the attorney™s duties of  candor to the tribunal. This c ourt holds that directing a client to make an affirmative  misrepresentation about attorney participation is  an act of dishonesty. Further, the court finds that a misrepresentation about attorney partic ipation is a material  misrepresentation in a  Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 5 of 44 6  bankruptcy proceeding. The court also notes that  these holdings on disclosure of attorney  participation appear to be ones of first impressi on in this court.  The court also acknowledges  that the issue of whether nondisclosure of attorney involvement is  an ethical violation is the subject of academic discussion and legal controversy between bar associations seeking to   provide citizens with more repr esentation and courts seeking to ensure fairness and candor in litigation. While Ms. Arthur directed her clients to make an affi rmative misrepresentation to the  court and she failed to disclose her participati on in the cases, the court  finds that she did not knowingly breach her duty to the tribunal based on  the state of the case law and applicable ethics  opinions regarding disclosure of attorney participation. The court also find that Ms. Arthur  violated Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011 by presenting the petitions for an improper purpose.Based on the  record before the court and for the reasons st ated below, the court GRANTS the Sanctions Motions in part and DENIES them in part. Th e court will not suspend Ms. Arthur but will  impose monetary and other sanctions as  compensation to the parties involved.   The court™s ruling is based upon the following  findings of fact and conclusions of law made pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7052 made app licable to contested matters by Fed. R. Bankr.  P. 9014(c). This court has jurisdiction over this contested matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332 and § 157 (b)(2)(A). I. FACTS   A.   Ms. Arthur™s Suspension History  Ms. Arthur is an experienced attorney.  She began her career as a law clerk for a  Tennessee Supreme Court justice and has been in private practice for approximately 35 years in   the Chattanooga area since leaving that position.  She has a substantial consumer bankruptcy  practice and has represented hundreds of debtors before this court. Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 6 of 44 7   In late March of 2012, Ms. Arthur had just  completed six months of active suspension imposed on her by the Board of Professional Res ponsibility for the Tennessee Supreme Court.   She was suspended because she continued practicing law while on administrative suspension.  Smith Exhibit #15; Henderson Exhibit #12. An ad ministrative suspension had been imposed on  Ms. Arthur in 2005 for failure to pay her registration fees to the Board of Professional Responsibility in Tennessee and her failure to pay her registration fees for four years in Georgia. Id.  While she was suspended she continued to pr actice law and file bankruptcy cases.   At the September 28, 2012 hearing on the  Sanctions Motions, she explained how the failure to pay her fees occurred. Her husband was her office manager at the time the fees were  due.  He neglected to pay her fees and did not inform her that her license had been suspended.  When she continued to practice during the administrative su spension, the Board imposed a  second round of sanctions on her for the unauthorized practice of law. These sanctions included six months of active suspension followed by eight een months of probation and supervision by a  practice mentor.  Id.  The Board imposed the sanctions on September 13, 2011, following Ms.  Arthur™s unsuccessful appeals to the Tennessee Circuit Court  and the Tennessee Court of Appeals. Smith Exhibit #20, Transcript of De position of Attorney Arthur, p.15, lines 23-25, p.  16, lines 1-5; Henderson Exhibit #23, Deposition Tran script of Attorney Arthur, p. 15, lines 23- 25, p. 16, lines 1-5. The sanctions became final  on September 23, 2011. At that time Ms. Arthur  left her office and did not practice law for the next six months.      Following the suspension imposed by the Tennessee Supreme Court, the District Court   issued a show cause order to Ms. Arthur pursuant to E. D. Tenn. LR 83.7(a) Œ (k).  Ms. Arthur responded to the show cause order but was not  successful. District Court Judge Curtis Collier  suspended Ms. Arthur from practice in the Di strict Court on November 10, 2011. Smith Exhibit  Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 7 of 44 8  #16; Henderson Exhibit #13.  The District Court order recited that she was ﬁSUSPENDED from  the practice of law in the United States District  Court, Eastern District of Tennessee, for the six  months of her active suspension with the Tennessee Supreme Court.  E.D.TN. LR 83.7(g).ﬂ  Smith Exhibit #16; Henderson Exhibit #13.   Beca use Ms. Arthur responded to the show cause order, the court finds that she was familiar with  the first eleven subsections of E. D. Tenn.  83.7(a)-(k). Had she familiarized herself with th e next subsection which described the process for reinstatement, this entire problem might have been avoided.    Ms. Arthur™s suspension from District C ourt affected her ability to appear in the  Bankruptcy Court. To practice before the Bankrup tcy Court, an attorney must be both admitted  to practice in the United States District Court fo r the Eastern District of Tennessee and must be  presently in good standing before the District Court. E.D.Tenn. LBR 2090-1(a)(1).  All attorneys  practicing before the Bankruptcy Court are also required to file their pleadings electronically  through the Electronic Case Filing System (ﬁECFﬂ ). Administrative Procedures for Electronic  Case Filing, I. A. Also, by General Order,  the Bankruptcy Court adopted Administrative  Procedures for Electronic Case Filing in 2005, as  amended in 2008 and 2012.  To be eligible to  use ECF, an attorney must be in good standing and admitted to practice in the District Court.   Administrative Procedures for Electronic Ca se Filing, II.A.1. Based on these rules and her suspension by the District Court, the Bankruptcy Court terminated her ECF privileges and she  lost her ability to appear in the Bankruptcy Court.   B.   Ms. Arthur™s Return to Practice   Ms. Arthur™s reinstatement by the Tennessee Supreme Court was automatic when the  term of her suspension expired. On March 23, 2 012, Ms. Arthur returned to her office and resumed practicing law. Within those first few days  and as a result of her contact with Mr. Smith,  Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 8 of 44 9  she learned from the Bankruptcy Court Deputy Cl erk that she could not resume electronic filing  in Bankruptcy Court until she was reinstated to practice in the District Court.   Subsection l of the same District Court local  rule that outlines the suspension procedures  also provides the procedure for reinstatement. E.D.Tenn. LR 83.7(l).  Ms. Arthur testified that she was not aware of the reinstatement requirement until her conversation with the Bankruptcy Court   Deputy Clerk. She continues to contend that there was nothing in the District Court™s order that would have alerted her to the fact that her suspension would last any longer than the state court  suspension. Whatever deficiencies she claims th e suspension order may have had, the District  Court Local Rules are quite clear abou t the procedures for reinstatement.   E.D.Tenn. LR 83.7(l) provides:    (l) Reinstatement.  Reinstatement shall be had only upon a petition by the  disciplined member. A former member who  has been suspended or disbarred from  the practice of law by this Court [District Court] because of suspension or  disbarment in another cour t of record may, upon  reinstatement to the other court,  file a petition for reinstatement to th is Court. Each petitioner shall pay an application fee to the Clerk which is not  refundable. The petition shall be filed with the Clerk and shall c ontain a concise statement of  the circumstances of the  disciplinary proceedings, the discipline  imposed, and the grounds that justify  reinstatement.  The petition shall be  signed by the petitioner under penalty of perjury stating that he or she has read the petition and that the factual allegations contained therein are correct to the be st of the petitioner™s knowledge. The petitioner has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that he or she has the requisite good moral charact er, ethical standards, professional competence, and learning in the law necessa ry to serve as an officer of the Court  and to be readmitted to the practice of law.   (1) A petitioner who has been susp ended for a definite term may be  automatically reinstated at the end of the  period of suspension upon filing the  petition for reinstatement accompanied by an affidavit showing compliance with   the provisions of the order of suspension.  E.D. Tenn. L.R. 83.7(l) (emphasis added).  In co mpliance with this rule, Ms. Arthur filed her  petition for reinstatement accompanied by an affi davit with the District Court on April 2, 2012.  Her petition for reinstatement was granted on Ap ril 12, 2012, without further notice or hearing. Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 9 of 44 10   C.   Representation of Mr. Smith   During her first week back at work in March of 2012, Ms. Arthur met with Mr. Smith  about filing bankruptcy. She testified that  she first met with Mr. Smith on March 24 th, and the petition was filed on March 28, 2012. She and her office gathered the necessary information  from him to file a chapter 13 petition and pr epared to file his petition and accompanying  schedules. It appears that all of the documents to commence a Chapter 13 case were prepared  and ready to file by March 28, 2012.  However, only the petition, the creditors™ matrix, the Social  Security Number Certification, the Certificate of Cr edit Counseling and the Application to pay the filing fee in installments (collectively ﬁSkele ton Filingsﬂ) were filed on that date.  Smith  Exhibit #20, Transcript of Deposition of Attorney Arthur, p. 59, lines 10-15; Henderson Exhibit   #23, Deposition Transcript of Attorney Arthur, p. 59, lines 10-15.  Ms. Arthur testified that she counseled Mr . Smith about filing his  own petition after she  learned that she could not file the petition until she was reinstated  to practice in the District  Court. In the process of discussing her filing problem with him, she disclosed that she had been  suspended and could not actually file the bankruptcy petition for him. She testified that she did  not discuss with him the possibili ty of obtaining other counsel. Ms. Arthur testified that ﬁshe had done all of the workﬂ and she believed that sending her work to another attorney would only delay the filing Mr. Smith needed.      Since she could not comply with this cour t™s rule mandating electr onic filing, she had Mr. Smith indicate on his petition that  he was not represented by an attorney so that the petition  could be filed. The petition contains the representation that the debtor ﬁdeclares under the penalty of perjury that the information provided  in this petition is true and correct. – [If no attorney represents me and no bankruptcy petition  preparer signs the petition] I have obtained Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 10 of 44 11  and read the notice required by 11 U.S.C. § 342(b).ﬂ Smith Exhibit #1, Smith Petition p. 3. On  Official Form 1 of the Skeleton Filings, below th e debtor™s signature, in the signature box for the  attorney there is a notation: ﬁDebtor not represented by attorney.ﬂ Ms. Arthur admitted that she   was originally listed as counsel on the filing but  removed her name from Mr. Smith™s petition  and inserted the statement about the debtor no t being represented by counsel. The petition does not contain any clarifying language to indicate that the debtor was acting pro se solely for  purpose of filing the Skeleton Filings.     Although Ms. Arthur contends that she had  limited the scope of  her representation and that Mr. Smith represented himself in filing th e Skeleton Filings, the court does not find that there is any evidentiary support for this contention. She did not reduce her attorney™s fee to reflect the debtor™s alleged assump tion of some of her duties. She  testified that she believed that  she had entered into a written representation ag reement with Mr. Smith, but that she had been  unable to find it. There is no evidence that she  had anything in writing that altered her standard representation agreement to reflect any limitation  in the scope of her representation. She did not  address verbally or in writing what Mr. Smith  would need to do if her reinstatement was not  automatic, or if the reinstatement did not occur un til after his first meeting of creditors, or if he  needed to file additional documents to preven t the dismissal of his case. Her office staff  physically delivered the Skeleton Filings to Bankruptcy Court to commence the case, so she  handled even the act of filing.   After receiving the or der of reinstatement from the Dist rict Court, she filed a notice of  appearance on April 16, 2012. At that time she filed th e remaining schedules, statement of affairs  and Chapter 13 Plan, although the schedules and statement of financial affairs appear to have  been ready to file on March 28, 2012  based on Mr. Smith™s signature on his statement of  Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 11 of 44 12  financial affairs.   In re Smith , No. 12-11603, Declaration Concerning Debtor™s Schedules, Doc. No. 22.  Although the record is not clear whether the plan signed by Ms. Arthur was available for filing on March 28th, Mr. Smith testified at his 341 meeting  that he went to Ms. Arthur™s office two or three times and the last time was on March 28 th.  Smith Exhibit # 14, at p. 21, lines 20-25,  p. 22, lines 1-15.   On March 28, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court or dered Mr. Smith to file the additional  documents by April 11, 2012. The order provided that  ﬁThe failure of the debtor(s) to comply  with this order will constitute cause for dism issal of this case. ... and the court may, without  further notice, enter an order summarily dismissing this case.ﬂ  In re Smith, No. 12-11603, Order Regarding Certain Unfiled Documents, Doc.

Because Ms. Arthur filed only the Skeleton  Filings and Mr. Smith™s petition stated that he  was not represented by counsel, only Mr. Smith  received the court notice of the  deficiencies in his Skeleton Fili ngs.  When Ms. Arthur made her  appearance, she filed the plan and served it on creditors and parties in interest on April 16, 2012, five days after the deadline. Plan [Doc. No. 27]; Certificate of Service [Doc. No. 31]. In Mr. Smith™s case, the meeting of creditors also had  to be rescheduled because insufficient notice of  the plan had been provided.    D.   Representation of Ms. Henderson     Ms. Arthur first met with Ms. Henderson  on April 7, 2012. By this time, she was aware  of the loss of her filing privileges and had filed her petition for reinstatement with the District  Court. Ms. Henderson™s bankruptcy petition was filed on April 11, 2012. Ms. Arthur was reinstated on April 12, 2012.   Ms. Arthur entered into her standard  representation agreement with Ms. Henderson.  Henderson Exhibit #16, Representation Agreement.  She provided counseling regarding which Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 12 of 44 13  chapter to file. She, with her office staff™s as sistance, prepared the petition and the creditors™  matrix. As she had with Mr. Smith™s filings, sh e had Ms. Henderson indicate on her petition that she was not represented by an attorney. The petition contains the representation that the debtor declares ﬁunder the penalty of perjury that the  information provided in th is petition is true and correct. – [If no attorney represents me and no ba nkruptcy petition preparer signs the petition] I have obtained and read the notice required by 11 U.S.C. § 342(b).ﬂ  Henderson Exhibit #1, Henderson Petition, p. 3. On Official Form 1  below Ms. Henderson™s signature, there is a  notation in the signature box for the attorney: ﬁDebtor not represented by attorney.ﬂ Ms. Henderson also signed her name on the petition in  the box reserved for the attorney™s signature. Ms. Arthur™s staff physically filed the Skeleton  Filings for Ms. Henderson with the Bankruptcy  Court. On April 12, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order requiring the debtor to file her plan, schedules and statement of  financial affairs in addition  to other required documents. The  deadline to complete the filing was April 25, 201 2. Ms. Arthur filed the required documents on  April 25, 2012, along with her notice of appearance. Although the additional filings were not  electronically filed until April 25, 2012, they appear to be based on information provided in the  intake documents completed by  Ms. Henderson on April 9, 2012, as indicated by her signature. Henderson Exhibits #1-6.   E.   Smith First Meeting of Creditors   At their respective first meetings of creditor s, both debtors were questioned extensively by the attorney for the Trustee about whether  they were represented by counsel. The Trustee  asked Mr. Smith if he had planned to file his pet ition and then have Ms. Arthur to come into the case later. Smith Exhibit #14, Transcript of  341 Meeting, p. 3, lines 19-21. When asked about  what he prepared, he answered, ﬁI followed he r guidance.ﬂ He testified that everything was Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 13 of 44 14  prepared at her office.  Id. at p. 15, lines 13-15.  He testified that he was not told how much the  fee would be. Id. at p. 22, line 20-22. He testified that Ms. Arthur told him that someone from  her office would file the petition with the court.  Id.  at p. 23, lines 5-24. He testified that he was not told why his petition had to be hand-delivered to the courthouse to be filed.  Id. at p. 23-24. His recollection about what he knew about th e problem created by the suspension follows:  Q: Did she ever tell you she was not going to be your attorney? A: No, sir.  Q: Did she tell you why you were initially going to be labeled as being pro se instead of her being your attorney when you filed the case?  A: We had a conversation  afterwards, yes, sir, but notŠnot prior to that.  Q: All right. And what was that conversation that was afterwards?  A: There was Œ I guess there was some issues with  the licensing or someth ing of that nature. I don™t really know all of the terminology.  Q: So, prior to your bankruptcy case being filed, you weren™t aware that Ms. Arthur wasn™t able to practice in the Bankruptcy Court?  A: No, sir.   Q:  And then you found out, after your petition got  filed, that she was not licensed to practice in  the Bankruptcy Court.  A: That there were some issues going on, yes, sir,  some issues that had to be addressed maybe. I  don™t–.  . . . . Q: Did she tell you that she was going to file a notice of appearance on your behalf sometime  after your petition got filed?  A: I don™t recall if I was told that or not. Q: All right. Did she tell you that, at some point in time, she  was later going to repŠthat she was later going to be your attorney in the bankruptcy case after the case got filed? A: Yes, sir.  Q: She did tell you that.  A: That, if I needed any assistance,  yes, sir, she would be available.   Id. at p. 24, lines 5-25, p. 25, lines 1-19.     F.   Henderson First Meeting of Creditors  The line of questioning was similar at Ms. He nderson™s meeting of creditors which began  on May 9, 2012, and continued on June 13, 2012. Ms. Henderson, who had filed eight previous  bankruptcy cases, was questioned about whether she had ever filed a bankruptcy for herself. She responded that she had, but that it was not this  case. Henderson Exhibit #11, Transcript of 341 Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 14 of 44 15  Meeting, p. 6, lines 1-7. She acknowledged taking her credit counseling at Ms. Arthur™s office and having the ﬁticketﬂ sent to her lawyer™s office. She was aware that Ms. Arthur was not able  to file the petition as her attorney. She testif ied that ﬁsomething happened to her license or  something, and then she got them back.ﬂ  Id. at p. 16, lines 23-25. She testified that she had Ms. Arthur file her documents for her and that she was  told later that Ms. Arthur could represent her. Id. at p. 8, lines 21-25. Although she knew that she had stated in her petition that she was not represented by an attorney, she did not know that she was signing her petition under penalty of perjury. She could not rememb er whether Ms. Arthur had discussed that with her. Id. at p. 9, lines 20-25, p. 10, lines 1-5. Ms. Henderson testified that she could not read or write. Id. at p. 8, line 6. From her other testimony, it does appear that she could write her name and had a limited   ability to read.  See, e.g., Henderson Exhibit #11, Transcript of 341 Meeting, p. 9, lines 13-19, p. 12, line 7-8; p. 12, lines 18-24.     The representation agreement she executed w ith Ms. Arthur contains nothing about Ms. Henderson™s filing her own petition. Henderson Exhibit #16, A Debt Relief Agency Re: Chapter 13/Representation Agreement. To the contrary,  the agreement states that Ms. Arthur would  ﬁ[p]repare [Ms. Henderson™s] bankruptcy petition, schedules, statemen t of affairs, and such other documents as are necessary, and review and file  the petition under the Chapter [she] select[ed].ﬂ Id. at ¶ 3.

Withdrawal by Ms. Arthur   Ms. Arthur has now withdrawn from repres entation of both debtors. She has received no fees for her services and she has voluntarily waived her right to receive any fees. Both cases have proceeded with substitute counsel.   II. ANALYSIS    The UST alleges that Ms. Arthur™s conduct  violates the Tennessee Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically, that she assisted Mr.  Smith and Ms. Henderson in filing a false and  misleading petition which stated that they we re not represented by counsel. He seeks the imposition of sanctions under 11 U.S.C. § 105(a) , the section granting the court power to discipline the attorneys appearing before it.  In re Riser , 58 Fed. Appx. 169, 171 (6th Cir. 2003). Mitan v. Int™l Fid. Ins. Co.,  23 Fed. Appx. 292, 298 (6th Cir. 2001). The Chapter 13 Trustee adds that she also violated Rule 9011 of the Federal Bankruptcy Rules by causing the misleading  petitions to be filed even though she did not sign them. He also alleges that she violated the  Tennessee Rules of Professional Conduct by faili ng to disclose her representation and engaging in ﬁghostwritingﬂ the pleadings for these debtors.    A.   Violations of Tennessee Rules of Professional Conduct  In determining whether any ethical viola tions have occurred which the court should sanction, the court must look to the Tennessee Ru les of Professional Conduct (ﬁTRPCﬂ), adopted as Rule 8 of the Rules of the Tennessee Supreme Court. Those rules have ﬁlikewise [been]  adopted by this court as rules of professional conduct to the extent they relate to matters within  this court™s jurisdiction.ﬂ E.D.Tenn. LBR 2090-2.  The court finds that the rules regarding dishonest conduct are TRPC 1.0(d), 1.2(d), 3.3, 3.4 and 8.4. In addition, Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011 Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 16 of 44 17  imposes obligations on parties who sign pleading file d with the court.  Ms. Arthur contends her conduct falls within an exception to these duties of candor in cases in which (1) the misrepresentation involves the nondisclosure of an  attorney™s participation in preparation of pleadings with  pro se litigants and (2) the attorney has limited the scope of her representation.  Because Ms. Arthur relies heavily on her position  that she limited the scope of her representation  to exclude the filing of the petition such that there was no misreprese ntation regarding her participation, the court will address whether her representation was limited and whether the   limitation violated TRPC 1.2(c).      1.  TRPC 1.2(c) Limitation of Scope of Representation    The Tennessee Rules of Professional Conduc t require that ﬁa lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. ﬁCompete nt representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably nece ssary for the representation.ﬂ TRPC 1.1.  In  determining whether a lawyer em ploys the requisite knowledge and skill in a particular matter,  the relevant factors to be considered are the lawyer™s general  experience, the lawyer™s training  and experience in the field in question, and whether it is feasible to refer the matter to another  attorney– or associate or consult with, a lawyer of established competence in the field in  question.  TRPC Rule 1.1, Comment [1]. When an  attorney is hired to make filings in a  particular court, one of the skills required in order to provide competent  assistance would be the ability to practice before the court in which the li tigation is to be initia ted. Alternatively, one of the acts of preparation would be to  obtain admission to that court  pro hac vice or to associate  counsel who was admitted so that the filing could  be made in compliance w ith the rules of that court. Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 17 of 44 18   When Ms. Arthur discovered that she had co mmitted to perform serv ices that she was not competent to perform, she attempted to limit th e scope of her employment in order to avoid  violating her ethical obligations. However, she ﬁassociatedﬂ not a nother attorney, but rather the debtors themselves to handle what she could not . Ms. Arthur argues that the Tennessee Rules of Professional Conduct allow such limitation. Under the facts presented to these two cases, the court disagrees.   Rule 1.2(c) provides:   A lawyer may limit the scope of representation if the limitation is  reasonable under the circumstances  and the client gives informed  consent, preferably in writing.   TRPC Rule 1.2(c). The court finds three problems with Ms. Arthur™s proposed limited  representation.  First, she did not effectively limit the scope of her representation.   Second, she did not obtain the informed consent of her clients.  Third, under the circumstances of these cases, a limitation th at left these debtors on their own for a few days and required them to make an inaccura te statement under oath was not reasonable.    (a)  The limitation was ineffective.   Ms. Arthur did not limit the scope of  her employment in her representation  agreements. She attempted to modify the ag reements verbally after their execution;  however, the form representation agreement  states, ﬁThis document represents the  complete agreement between the parties and may  not he [sic] modified or replaced except by subsequent written agreement of the part ies.ﬂ Henderson Exhibit # 16, A Debt Relief Agency Re: Chapter 13/Representation Agreement, p. 2. The court acknowledges that  TRPC Rule 1.2(c) does not require that the  limitation be in writing, only that it is  preferable that there be a writing. However, the Bankruptcy Code does require a written  engagement agreement that specifies what the  attorney will do for the debtor.  11 U.S.C. Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 18 of 44 19  § 528(a)(1).  Failure to provide the services promised is another violation of the  Bankruptcy Code. 11 U.S.C. § 526(a)(1). Agreements in violation of these sections are  void. 11 U.S.C. § 526(c). The court finds that the verbal attempt to limit her  representation was ineffective under the terms of her cont ract and under applicable bankruptcy law.   (b)  The debtors did not give in formed consent to the limitation.    Even if Ms. Arthur™s limitation had been  effective, the court would still have to determine whether the debtors gave their informed  consent to the limitation negotiated after Ms.  Arthur learned of her inability to appear before the Bankruptcy Court.   Informed consent is a defined term in  the TRPC. ﬁInformed Consent denotes the  agreement by a person to a proposed course of  conduct after the lawyer has communicated  adequate information and explanation about th e material risks of a nd reasonably available alternatives to the proposed course of conduct.ﬂ TRPC Rule 1.0(e). The comments elaborate on  this process.  Ordinarily, [obtaining informed consent] will require communication that  includes a disclosure of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the  situation, any explanation reasonably necessary to inform the client or   other person of the material advantag es and disadvantages of the proposed course of conduct and a discussion of the client™s or other person™s options and alternatives. In some circumstance s it may be appropriate for a lawyer  to advise a client or other person to seek the advice of other counsel. Id., Comment [6].    At their meetings of creditors, both debtor s testified that they were aware that Ms.  Arthur could not file their petitions for them.  There is nothing in wr iting from Ms. Arthur  in evidence that discloses to these debtors that  they must file their own petitions. There is  no evidence that Ms. Arthur communicated what  problems her inability  to appear in court might cause these individuals. There is nothing th at tells them that, until she is reinstated,  Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 19 of 44 20  they will receive notices from the court and th at their cases may be dismissed if they fail  to respond. She did not inform them that she w ould not be able to appear at any hearings on their behalf, including their first meeting of creditors, un til she was reinstated. She did not discuss with them the imp lications of signing a representation agreement with her,  only to then declare under penalty of perjury that they were not represented by counsel.  Ms. Arthur admits she did not discuss reta ining other counsel with them. She did not  disclose what other counsel could do for them  that she could not. In addition to failing to  make any such disclosures to ensure that  they understood that her representation was limited, she acted in a manner inconsistent  with her own assertion that she did not represent these debtors with respect to f iling their petitions. He r office staff actually  delivered the pleadings to the court. Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, the court finds that Ms. Arthur did not obtain the informed consent of her clients to limit the  scope of her representation.     (c)  The limitations were not reasonable.   TRPC 1.2 (c) imposes a requirement of reasonableness on any limitation of the scope of  representation.  Ms. Arthur contends that she limited the scope of her representation as  contemplated by Rule 1.2(c) and therefore she di d nothing unethical. Ms. Arthur did not explain at the hearing why she thought a limitation that left her clie nts without counsel during an indefinite period was reasonable. In her brief, she argues that ﬁ[i]t is very typical, during the period immediately following a skelet on petition, for the client not to require the services of an attorney of record. This proved to be true in both cases.ﬂ  Henderson, 12-11857, Addendum to  the Trial Brief of Barbara S. Arthur at 4 [Doc. No. 102]; Smith, 12-11603, Addendum to the  Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 20 of 44 21  Trial Brief of Barbara S. Arthur at 4 [Doc. N o. 114]. The court disagrees with both her general premise and her assertion that it was tr ue under the specifics of these cases.   In every case in which a skeleton petition is  filed, the court issues a deficiency notice within a day or two of the filing, requiring that  additional filings must be made by a date certain  or the case will be dismissed. That notice is sent  to the attorney of record unless the debtor is  pro se. In that case the notice of a potential dismissal  is sent to only the debtor.  Also during the early days of a case, the court frequently hears both motions for contempt arising from actions by  repossessing creditors who ignore the stay and motions  to dismiss or for relie f from the stay filed  by creditors alleging that the cases were filed in bad faith.  All of these motions may be set on  shortened notice and the reduction in time may be obtained  ex parte. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9006(c); E.D. Tenn. LBR 9006-1(a) and (b).    As for the potential risk of  an aggressive secured creditor  seeking relief from the stay,  both of these debtors sought Ms. Arthur™s help  because of their concerns about repossession. As  for potential allegations of bad faith, Ms. Henderson had filed eight previous cases.  The  existence of numerous previous filings is  a common allegation made to support a motion to  dismiss for bad faith. Keith M. Lundin & William H. Brown, C HAPTER 13 BANKRUPTCY , 4th ed. § 334.1 at ¶ 7 (2004)( ﬁThe most compelling evidence  of bad faith in support of dismissal of a  Chapter 13 case is often a history of serial, mu ltiple or abusive filings by the debtor.ﬂ) Had hearings on such motions been scheduled before  April 12th, Ms. Arthur would not have been able to appear on their behalf even if Mr.  Smith had understood what a notice of the hearing  meant without her guidance or if  Ms. Henderson had even been able to read the notice. The fact that there was no harm done to these debtors is  attributable more to luck than to the reasonableness of Ms. Arthur™s limitation of her  services with respect to  these two debtors.  Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 21 of 44 22   In Mr. Smith™s case, a problem ﬁduring th e period immediately following a skeleton  filingﬂ was not a hypothetical issue.  Mr. Smith faced dismissal of hi s case for the deficiencies in  the Skeleton Filings. The court sent Mr. Smith a  notice that his case coul d be dismissed if the  additional pleadings were not filed by Wedne sday, April 11, 2012, the day before Ms. Arthur was reinstated. Smith, 12-11603, Doc. No. 5.  But fo r the court™s delay in entering the order of dismissal after the deadline, Mr. Smith™s case wo uld have been dismisse d. Ms. Arthur did not file the required pleadings until Monday, April  16, 2012, although at least some of the required  documents had been prepared during his initial m eeting with her.  Smith Exhibit #14, Transcript  of 341 Meeting, p. 27, line 17-21. If Mr. Smith had b een required to refile his case to obtain the relief Ms. Arthur had agreed to seek for him, he would have had  to carry the additional burden of showing changed circumstances under 11 U.S.C. § 362 (c)(3) to obtain the protection of the automatic stay for more than thirty days.    Just as risky as leaving her  clients without an attorney early in the case was her request that her clients make a statemen t under penalty of perjury that was inconsistent with the written representation agreement she had  already had them execute.  Th e debtors were represented by counsel in every way except for the physical act of filing, based on Ms. Arthur™s testimony, and her office staff handled even that act. Based on the existence of the terms of the representation  agreements, and her continuing to act as their atto rney for all purposes, the court finds that these debtors were never pro se. The statement that they were not  represented by an attorney was not accurate, and Ms. Arthur was aware that it was not  accurate.  Their petitions  left the court with the impression that there was no attorney involved.  A limitation in the scope of representation   that requires a client to make an affirmative mi srepresentation to the court is not a reasonable limitation and, as discussed below, is  a dishonest act in violation of an attorney™s ethical duties. Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 22 of 44 23  For the foregoing reasons, the court finds that Ms. Arthur failed to limit her scope of her  representation in compliance with TRPC 1.2(c).    2.  Duties of Candor toward the Tribunal    Having found that these debtors were repres ented by counsel, the court finds that the statements that they were not represented by  counsel were misreprese ntations regarding the participation of an attorney in their bankruptcy  cases. The court must now address whether Ms.  Arthur™s nondisclosure of her participation was an act of fraud or dishonesty which violates TRPC Rules 1.2(d), 3.3, 3.4 or 8.4(c) and/or Rule 9011.    In response to the trustees™ contentions  that she committed an ethical violation, she  emphasizes that an inaccurate stat ement about the level of her participation is not significant to the relief sought by the debtors in their bankruptcy cases. In response to the trustees™ contention that she assisted her clients in making a misrep resentation that would subject her clients to charges of perjury, Ms. Arthur argues that her  clients were not at risk of committing perjury  because their statements about having an attorn ey were not material misrepresentations. Smith,  12-11603, Trial Brief of Barbara S. Arthur at 4 [Doc. No. 102]; Henderson, 12-11857, Trial  Brief of Barbara S. Arthur at 4 [Doc. No. 102].     The court finds her reliance on the immateriality  of the false statement as the excuse for her conduct surprising. Upon further review of the law in this area, the court also finds her position has some support when the misrepresent ation involves a failure to disclose the participation of an attorney in drafting a pleading filed for a  pro se  litigant. In order to determine  whether Ms. Arthur violated the ethics rules,  the court must address whether materiality is a  requirement for a finding of an ethical violati on based on fraud, dishonesty, misrepresentation or  Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 23 of 44 24  deceit. If materiality is a requirement, then it must  decide whether the participation of an attorney  in preparation of pleadings is a mate rial fact that mu st be disclosed.  (a)  Materiality of the misrepresenta tion is a requirement for a finding of dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.    From an analysis of the TRPC and the releva nt definitions, the court concludes that there  is a requirement that the misrep resentation must be material. TR PC 1.2(d) states that a lawyer shall not counsel a client to engage, or assist a client, in conduct that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know is fraudulent.  ﬁFraudulentﬂ is a defined term that:   denotes an intentionally false or misleading statement of  material  fact, an  intentional omission from a statement of  fact of such additional information as  would be necessary to make the statements made not  materially  misleading, and  such other conduct by a person intended to deceive a person or tribunal with respect to a  material  issue in a proceeding or other matter.     TRPC 1.0(d) (emphasis added).  ﬁ‚ Material™ or ‚materially™ denot es something that a reasonable  person would consider important in assessing or determining how  to act in a matter.ﬂ TRPC  1.0(o).  TRPC 8.4(c) states an attorney may not  engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. Of  these prohibited actions, fraud, by definition, incorporates a  materiality requirement.  TRPC 1.0 (d).      Other rules do not use the term materiality.  They require that the misrepresentation be  knowing. TRPC 3.3(a)(1) states that a lawyer shall not knowingly make a fa lse statement of fact  or law to a tribunal. TRPC 3.4(b) states that a lawyer shall not assist a witness to offer false or  misleading testimony.  ﬁKnowsﬂ is also a defined  term which ﬁdenotes act ual awareness of the fact in question.ﬂ TRPC 1.0(f). Requiring materialit y and knowledge that a statement is false in  order to find an ethical violation would excuse the inadvertent misstatem ent about a matter that  is not significant to the case. To the extent that  an attorney knows that a fact or statement is  important to a determination of the claims made  in the litigation or knows that representation of  Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 24 of 44 25  that fact is inaccurate or misleading, she is pr ohibited from making such a statement to the court  or allowing her client to do so.    The court does not believe Ms. Arthur is  arguing that she is free to make misleading,  material statements to the court. Rather, she is  relying on several ethics opinions and one federal court of appeals opinion that find that a statement about the level  of attorney involvement with a  litigant is not material to the cl aims raised in that litigation.  In re Fengling Liu, 664 F.3d 367, 372 (2d  Cir. 2011). See Salman Bhojani, Comment,  Attorney Ghostwriting for Pro Se Litigants Œ  A Practical and Bright- Line Solution to Resolve the Split of Authority Among Federal Circuits and State Bar Associations, 65 SMU L. Rev. 653, 663 (2012); Jeffrey P. Justman, Note,  Capturing the Ghost: Expanding Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 to Solve  Procedural Concerns with Ghostwriting, 92 Minn. L. Rev. 1246, 1288 (2008).  From these sources she  argues that, even if the court finds that there was a misreprese ntation about her involvement, it  was a misrepresentation about an immaterial matte r, and a misrepresentati on about an immaterial  matter is not an ethical violation.   These sources have addressed the issue of the  disclosure of attorney participation in the  context of ghostwriting, a practice in which an attorney drafts a pleading to be filed with the court, but does not disclose his involvement. The pleading is signed only by the litigant.  This is   what Ms. Arthur did for these debtors. Despite  a substantial amount of academic discussion on  the topic, the majority of federal courts and  the position of the Tennessee Board of Professional Responsibility, as stated in its formal ethics opi nions, do not treat the nondisclosure of attorney participation as immaterial.

(i)  The vast majority of federal c ourts require disclosure of attorney participation.   Prior to 2011, the federal courts were al most unanimous in their condemnation of  attorneys and litigants who failed to disclose the pa rticipation of an attorney in the preparation of  pleadings filed with the court. See Ira P. Robbins, Ghostwriting: Filling in the Gaps of Pro Se Prisoners™ Access to the Courts , 23 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 271, 285 and n.73 (2010)(ﬁThe federal  courts have almost universally condemned ghostw riting.ﬂ (collecting cases)).  These federal   cases do not address the propriety of the disclosure of attorney involvement in terms of  materiality.  They address the importance of  fairness, candor, and compliance with the  procedural rules and the risk that ghostwriting poses to those aspects of the administration of  justice. Specifically, these courts objected to ghostwriting on the basis that (i) nondisclosure of attorney representation unfairly causes a more  lenient standard to be applied to a  pro se litigant  who is not really pro se , (ii) it violates the attorney™s duty of candor to the court, and (iii) it violates the attorney™s obligations  under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to sign pleadings and to certify that the claims and defens es raised in those pleadings are not frivolous. Duran v. Carris, 238 F.3d 1268,1273-74 (10th Cir. 2001)(listing federal cases and the courts™ objections to ghostwriting).  At worst, the practice can be viewed as a deliberate avoidance of that certification obligation. One court also found that ﬁghostwriting arrangements interfere with  the Court™s ability to superintend the conduct  of counsel and parties during the litigation.ﬂ  United  States v. Eleven Vehicles , 966 F. Supp. 361, 367 ( E.D. Pa. 1997). The participation of an attorney in the preparation of the pleadings is ﬁsomethingﬂ that these judges ﬁconsider important  Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 26 of 44 27  in assessing or determining how to act in a matter. ﬂ TRPC 1.0(o).  This fact is material under the  TRPC™s definition of that term.      Like the majority of federal district and  appellate courts, the bankruptcy courts have taken a dim view of ghostwriting. In  In re Mungo, the Bankruptcy Court for the District of South Carolina addressed a motion to convert and a moti on to reinstate the auto matic stay prepared by  an attorney but filed as a  pro se filing. 305 B.R. 762 (Bankr. D. S.C. 2003). It recognized that ghostwriting was prohibited as a violation of the South Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Id. at 767.  Following its analysis of federal cases, the court concluded that there are certain degrees of undisclosed attorney guidance for clients that need not be prohibited, such as limited assistance  to family and friends on some specialized area  of knowledge. Id. at 768.   Attorneys cross the line, however, when they gather and anonymously present  legal arguments, with the act ual and constructive knowledge  that the work will be  presented in some similar form in a  motion before the Court. With such  participation the attorney guides the cour se of litigation wh ile standing in the shadows of the Courthouse door.   Id. at 768 (quoting Ricotta v. Cal.,  4. F. Supp. 2d 961, 987 (S.D. Cal. 1998)). The court held that ghostwriting was an ethical violation. However, since there was  only ﬁlimited authority addressing the matter of ghost-writing within th e District of South Carolina,ﬂ the court determined the fairest treatment  of the attorney™s conduct was to set a clear standard for the future and only admonish the attorney who authored the motions.  Id. at 770.   In   In re West , 338 B.R. 906, 916-17 (Bankr. N.D.Okla. 2006), the court found an attorney who coached his client to file a motion  pro se because the attorney had not obtained  electronic filing privileges violated the Federal Rules of Ci vil Procedure and his ethical obligations. In In re Brown, 354 B.R. 535 (Bankr. N.D.Okla. 2006), the court publicly Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 27 of 44 28  admonished an attorney who had ghostwritten a  pleading after the court had found that he was not disinterested and could not be counsel for the chapter 12 debtor. The [Duran v.]Carris  decision and its progeny have ma de the rule in this circuit  clear: if an attorney writes  a pleading, he or she has a duty to make sure that the  Court knows he or she wrote it. The Court is not required to play a game of  ﬁcatch-me -if -you-canﬂ with a ghostwriter.  All counsel owe a duty of candor to every court in which they appear. Inherent in that duty is the requirement that  counsel disclose his or her involvement in the case. The fact that [the attorney] chose not to disguise his ghostwriting is  not a substitute for disclosure of his  authoring the Objection and Motion to Reconsider.   Id. at 545 (citing Duran v. Carris, 238 F. 3d 1268 (10th Cir. 2001))(footnote omitted).    (ii)  The ABA Ethics Opinion finds that nondisclosure of representation is not a material misrepresentation unless th ere is applicable law or a tribunal  rule that requires disclosure.   In recognition of a growing number of  pro se appearances and to improve access to legal  representation for those litigants,  state bar associations and the American Bar Association began  addressing issues related to the ﬁunbundling of legal services.ﬂ See Carl A. Pierce, ﬁWhen Less  Legal Service May Mean More Access to Justice,ﬂ 41 Tenn. B. J. 22 (February 2005)(discusses   Tenn. Informal Advisory Opinion No. 2004-A- 811 provided to Memphis Community Legal  Clinic and the Administrative Office  of Cour ts™ Working Group on Self Represented Litigants  which required disclosure of attorney assistance in order to comply with requirement of candor  to the court). The ABA Model Rules allow for the limitation of services. ABA Model Rule   1.2(c). In cases where the limitation provided for th e attorney to assist with pleadings without appearing in court, the attorney was faced w ith the dilemma of whether to disclose his  involvement when he had no intention of appearing  again in the case. In light of the existing case law on ghostwriting and some state ethics opinio ns, the American Bar Association Committee on  Ethics and Professional Responsibil ity addressed the ﬁdivergent conclusionsﬂ that state and local ethics committees were reachingﬂ on the issue  of disclosure. ABA Comm . on Ethics & Prof™l  Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 28 of 44 29  Responsibility, Formal Op. 07-446 (2007)(ﬁABA Et hics Opinionﬂ). The committee issued a  formal opinion in 2007 which states that in th e committee™s opinion ﬁthe  fact that a litigant  submitting papers to a tribunal on a  pro se  basis has received legal assistance behind the scenes  is not material to the merits of the litigation.ﬂ  Id.at 2 (discussing undisclosed legal assistance to pro se litigants).  The Bhojani comment, cited above,  interprets that statement as evidence that  the ABA™s current position is that ﬁghostwriting attorneys do not violate their duties to the court  because the behind-the-scenes legal assist ance is not a material fact.ﬂ Bhojani,  supra at 664.    The ABA Ethics Opinion superseded ABA  Comm. on Ethics & Prof™l Responsibility, Inf. Op. 1414 (1978) (ﬁABA Informal Op. 1414) . ABA Formal Op. 07-446 at 4. That informal  opinion addressed the issue of whether there were any ethical restrictions applicable to a lawyer  who, without entering an appearance, had counseled a litigant who purported to appear before the court  pro se. It concluded that ﬁextensive undisclosed participation by a lawyer– that permits the litigant to falsely appear as being  without substantial assistance of counsel is  improper for the reasons noted above.ﬂ Those reas ons included the prohibition in Disciplinary Rule 1-102(A)(4) of the Model Rules of Professional Responsibility that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. ABA Informal Op.  1414. The informal opinion focused on whether the  nondisclosure gave a false impression about  the pro se status of the litigant to the court. It  did not address the materiality of the  representation.    Apparently to address its pr ior opinion that nondisclosure would violate DR 1-102(A)(4), now Model Rule 8.4(c), the ABA Committee on Ethics & Professi onal Responsibility opined in  2007 specifically that the ﬁunbundling of legal servicesﬂ did not violate Model Rules 1.2(d) (prohibition against counseling a client to engage in criminal  or fraudulent conduct), 3.3(b) Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 29 of 44 30  (candor toward the tribunal), 4.1(b) (truthfulness in statements to others ), or 8.4(c) (professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduc t involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation).  ABA Formal Op. at 2.    The impact of the ABA Ethics Opinion on th e analysis of ethics violations involving ghostwriting is limited by two statements in  the opinion. First, the Committee notes a  qualification. For purposes of its opinion it ﬁassume[d] a jurisd iction where no law or tribunal rule requires disclosure of such participation, prohibits litigants from employing lawyers (e.g.,  pro se courts), or otherwise regulate such undisclosed advice or drafting. If there is such a regulation, the boundaries of the lawyer™s obligation are beyond  the scope of this opinion.ﬂ  ABA Formal Op. 07-446 at 2, n.6. Second, the Co mmittee™s acceptance of nondisclosure of  participation as an ethical act of limited representation does not extend to affirmative   misrepresentations. The ABA Ethics Opinion allo ws nondisclosure of an attorney™s involvement,  but states that an ﬁaffirmative stat ement by the client, that can be attributed to the lawyer, that the  documents were prepared without legal assistan ceﬂ is attorney dishonesty and violates Rule  8.4(c).  Id. at 4.   (iii)  The Second Circuit Court of Appeals relies on the local bar association™s position adoption of the ABA Ethics Opinion and refuses to sanction a ghostwriter.  In 2011, the Second Circuit Cour t of Appeals broke with the long line of federal cases which had found nondisclosure of participation a nd ghostwriting to be ethical violations.  It  relied on the New York County Lawyer™s Association™s adoption of the ABA Ethics Opinion  position, and held that there were not clear prohibitions against ghostwriting within its jurisdiction. In re Fengling Liu, 664 F.3d at 372.(ﬁIn light of this Court™s lack of any rule or precedent governing attorney ghostwriting, and the va rious authorities that permit that practice,  we conclude that Liu could not have been aware of any general obligation to disclose her  Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 30 of 44 31  participation to this court.ﬂ) This ruling was contrary to the prohibition against ghostwriting adopted by the First and Tenth Circuits prior to the issuance of the ABA Ethics Opinion. Duran, 238 F.3d at 1272-73 (discussion of cases finding ghost writing violates an attorney™s ethical obligations); Ellis v. Maine , 448 F.2d 1325,1328 (1st Cir. 1971).   In holding that the attorney should not  be sanctioned, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals quoted the ABA Ethics Opinion allowing ghostwriting where the attorney could show that she had followed Rule 1.2 of the Rules of Professional Conduct and limited her  representation.2  The court also noted that the Committee on Professional Ethics for the New York County Lawyers™ Association had concluded in 2010 that ﬁit is now ethically permissible  for an attorney, with the informed  consent of his or her client, to play a limited role and prepare  pleadings and other submissions for a pro se litig ant without disclosing the lawyer™s participation  to the tribunal and adverse counsel.ﬂ In re Fengling Liu, 664 F.3d at 371(quoting  NYCLA Comm. on Prof™l Ethics, Op. 742 at 1 (2010)).  Ho wever, the court still required disclosure in situations where a particular  rule, order or circumstance  mandated disclosure or when  nondisclosure would constitute a misrepresentation.  ﬁ[T]he attorney need not reveal his or her  identity and may instead indicate on the ghostwr itten document that it was ‚Prepared with the  assistance of counsel admitted in New York.™ﬂ Id.     In adopting a more tolerant  view of ghostwriting, the Liu court also addressed the two most often stated concerns of other federal courts. ﬁRegarding the benefit of liberal construction afforded to  pro se pleadings,ﬂ the court adopted the ABA Ethics Committee™s argument that the  assistance of counsel would be evident to th e tribunal and was therefore not ﬁa reasonable                                                  2 The ABA Ethics Opinion holds that providing undisclosed legal assistance to  pro se  litigants constitutes a form of  limited representation, pursuant to ABA Model Rules of Prof essional Conduct 1.2(c), whic h states that ﬁ[a] lawyer  may limit the scope of the representation [of a client] if th e limitation is reasonable u nder the circumstances and the  client gives informed consent.ﬂ ABA Model Rules of Prof™l Conduct R. 1.2(c);  In re Fengling Liu , 664 F.3d at 370.  Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 31 of 44 32  concern.ﬂ  In re Fengling Liu, 664 F.3d at 370-71.  ﬁRegarding the attorney™s potential dishonesty in avoiding accountability for his representation,ﬂ the court cited the ABA Ethics Opinion and stated that ﬁthere is no such dishonesty as long as the client does not make an  affirmative representation, attribut able to the attorney, that the pleadings were prepared without an attorney™s assistance.ﬂ   Id. at 372 (citing the ABA Ethics Opinion at 4).   (iv) Even the adoption of a lenient standard on ghostwriting would not excuse Ms. Arthur™s affirmativ e misstatements about attorney  participation.      This court has been unable to find any ru ling by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals indicating whether it would follow the Tenth Ci rcuit™s strict prohibition against ghostwriting expressed in Duran v. Carris or the Second Circuit™s more  tolerant approach adopted in In re Fengling Liu.  Even if this court were to apply the more lenient view advocated by Ms. Arthur  and espoused in the ABA Ethics Opinion, that view finds that only silence on the issue of representation is acceptable.  An affirmative mi sstatement made by a client at an attorney™s  suggestion is still prohibited. On Mr. Smith™s peti tion, there is the statemen t that ﬁDebtor is not represented by counsel.ﬂ  Ms. Henderson™s petition contains the same representation. Ms. Arthur  prepared the petitions. She admits that she came up with the  pro se solution to her filing problem. She admits she or her staff inserted the  sentence ﬁDebtor is not represented by counselﬂ on the petition where she should have signed. The court finds that this was an affirmative  misrepresentation regarding the  participation of their attorne y. The misrepresentation made by  the debtors is attributable to their attorney. Ms. Arthur™s involvement in that misrepresentation is  an act of dishonesty. TRPC 8.4(c); ABA Ethics Opinion at 4.  (v)  The Tennessee Board of Pr ofessional Responsibility excuses disclosure of assistance in limited situations not applicable in these cases.   Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 32 of 44 33   Without controlling federal precedent, the  court will do as the S econd Circuit did and  look to the rules of professional conduct that have been adopted by this court. They are the TRPC. E.D. Tenn. LBR 2090-2. The Board™s position has evolved from its first formal opinion  in 1985 to the most recent opinion in 2007 on undi sclosed participation. Under the Tennessee  Rules of Professional Responsibility, which preceded the TRPC, the ﬁextensive undisclosed participation by a lawyerﬂ was ﬁimproper.ﬂ Tenn essee Formal Ethics Op. 85-F-83(1985)(quoting  ABA Informal Ethics Op. 1414 (1978))(ﬁ1985 Formal Opinionﬂ).  The 1985 Formal Opinion   addressed whether a county attorney could draft  pleadings and assist in the execution and filing of an agreed order without appearing as counsel or signing the documents. It was a very short  opinion and its entire discussion of the issue was a brief quotation from the ABA Informal Ethics  Op. 1414.    In 2004, the Board issued an informal opini on on limited representati on and disclosure of attorney assistance to the Community Lega l Center of Memphis, Tennessee and the  Administrative Office of the  Courts™ Working Group on Self Represented Litigants. The opinion  addressed how attorneys could provide limited serv ice in a legal clinic environment and whether  they had to sign the pleadings that they prepared.  The informal opinion suggested that attorneys put a legend on the pleadings disclosing their participation in order to meet their duty of candor  to the court. On June 17, 2005, the Board adopted its informal opinion as a formal opinion and  issued Tennessee Formal Ethics Op. 2005-F-151  (ﬁ2005 Formal Opinionﬂ). That opinion again  relied on the ABA Informal Op. 1414. The Board  acknowledged that the Code of Professional Responsibility had been replaced by the Code of Professional Conduct, but that the ﬁrationale remained the same.ﬂ It opined that extensive und isclosed participation by a lawyer that permits  the litigant falsely to appear as being without  substantial assistance of counsel is improper. 2005  Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 33 of 44 34  Tn. Formal Op. 2005-F0151 at 5. The Board agreed  with Delaware State Bar Ethics Opinion 1994-2 which required an attorney to disclose his participation to the court. After reviewing Florida Bar Opinion 79-7, Alaska Bar Opinion 93-1, and New York City Bar Formal Opinion  1987-2 and Virginia Legal Ethics Opinion 1127, the Board determined that:  notifying the court that counsel has assisted the Pro Se litigant without expectation that counsel will appear and represent the client in the manner   described by the inquiring attorneys is sufficient. The phrase ﬁPrepared  with the Assistance of Counselﬂ is recommended for inclusion on such pleadings in a prominent manner.     Id.  Two years later and at approximately the  same time the ABA Committee issued the ABA  Ethics Opinion, the Tennessee Board of Professional Responsibility revisited its position on undisclosed representation.  Tennessee Formal Ethics Op. 20 07-F-153. (ﬁ2007 Formal Opinionﬂ)  The Board noted that the 1985 Formal Opinion had relied on the ABA Informal Op. 1414 which   in turn relied on a disciplinary rule that was no longer applicable because of the change from the  Rules of Professional Responsibility to the TRPC. After finding that the disciplinary rule was no longer applicable, the Board proceeded to address the propriety of lawyers assisting pro se litigants in preparing pleadings wherein they fail to identify their assistance on the pleadings.  The opinion does not adopt the ABA Ethics Opinion™s new position on the materiality of  representations about disclosure.  Instead, it repeats the language of ABA Informal Op. 1414.  After acknowledging the prohibitions of TRPC  8.4(c) against dishonesty, fraud, deceit and  misrepresentation and TRPC 1.2(d) (assisting a c lient in fraudulent conduct), it states that: Thus, an attorney in Tennessee may not engage in  extensive undisclosed participation in litigation in behalf of a  pro se litigant as doing so permits and  enables the false appearance of being without substantial professional assistance. Tennessee Formal Ethics Op. 2007-F-153 at 1.  The Board then elaborates on what it  considers not to be ﬁextensive undisclosed participationﬂ:  Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 34 of 44 35  This prohibition does not extend to providing undisclosed assistance to a truly pro se litigant. Thus, an attorney may  prepare a leading pleading including, but not limited to, a complaint, or demand for  arbitration, request for reconsideration or other document required to toll a  statute of limitations, administrative  deadline or other proscriptive rule, so long as the attorney does not continue undisclosed assistance of the pro se litigan t. The attorney should be allowed, in such circumstances, to elect to have the  attorney™s assistance disclosed or remain  undisclosed. To require disclosure for such limited, although important,  assistance would tend to discourage the assistance of litigants for the protection   of the litigants™ legal rights. Such  limited assistance is not deemed to be in  violation of RPC 8.4(c). Board of Prof™l Responsibility, Formal  Op. 2007-F-153 at 1-2(2007)(emphasis added) .  The 2007 Formal Opinion does not mention  the 2005 Formal Opinion, although it seems  to undercut the requirement that the legend ﬁPrepared with the Assistance of Counselﬂ must  appear on the pleading. The 2007 Formal Opini on seems to allow ghostwriting without any  disclosure, but only to the extent  of providing assistance for the preparation of a leading pleading for a pro se litigant. It still prohibits an attorney from preparing ﬁpleadings and other legal  documents to assist a pro se litigant in the conduct  of his or her litigation where doing so creates  the false impression that the litigant is without substa ntial legal assistance.ﬂ  Id. at 2. Based on the  2007 Formal Opinion, the court concludes that  Tennessee has not adopted the position of the  ABA Committee that a representation regarding  the existence of counsel is not a material  representation. Any nondisclosure wh ich misleads the court about the  existence of the substantial assistance of counsel is  still prohibited.   The use of the terms ﬁextensiveﬂ and ﬁlimitedﬂ creates some confusion about when   ﬁlimited assistanceﬂ becomes ﬁexte nsive participation.ﬂ Had the court found that Mr. Smith and  Mrs. Henderson were truly pro se on the date of filing and had Ms. Arthur made no  representation about whether there was attorney participation, her conduct would not have violated TRPC 8.4(c) based on the 2007 Formal  Opinion™s interpretation of the TRCP. If the court were to find that the length of time that  Ms. Arthur™s misrepresentation continued is the  Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 35 of 44 36  only consideration, then it would be hard pressed to find a violation based on nondislcosure. Ms. Arthur prepared a leading pleading - the bankruptcy petition - without disclosing her involvement.  She did not continue her undisclose d involvement. To the contrary, she disclosed  her involvement within days of the filing. Howe ver, the 2007 Formal Opinion does not excuse  her conduct. Her clients were not pro se and she assisted them in making a misrepresentation  about their relationship with her. The Board did not adopt the position that attorney participation is not material to the claims ma de in the litigation. It adopted the language of ABA Informal Op.  1414 which focuses the analysis on whether the court was misled by the undisclosed participation.  In these cases, the court finds  that it relied on the debtors™ representations, suggested by Ms. Arthur, that they were not represented by counsel, and it sent the deficiency notices alerting the debtors to the potential for dismissal of their cases to the debtors who were  relying on Ms. Arthur for represen tation.  For that reason, the court finds that the nondisclosure was extensive enough to mislead the c ourt, and therefore it was improper.  (vi)  Facts regarding attorney participation are important to a bankruptcy  court™s determination of how to administer the case.     Having found that Ms. Arthur was involved in an  act of dishonesty and that she assisted her clients in making a misrepresentation to th e court, the court will address whether that  misrepresentation may be excused because it was  immaterial under the definition of material in  the TRPC. In light of the divergent views on the issue of disclosure of attorney participation and the lack of Sixth Circuit case law on this issue, the court also believes that clarification of its  position on the materiality of a fact regarding  attorney participation in the preparation of  bankruptcy pleadings is necessary. The court  is not persuaded that the ABA Committee™s  position on the materiality of nondisclosure is app licable in a bankruptcy context. The provisions of the Bankruptcy Code make disclosure of attorn ey participation material  to a bankruptcy case. Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 36 of 44 37  There are specific statutory provisions which  involve the court in the debtor/attorney  relationship. Those provisions raise the following issues:  1. Whether the attorney is a ﬁdebt relief agency?ﬂ [11 U.S.C. § 101(12A)]; 2. whether the debtor™s attorney is disinterested and therefore even qualified to be counsel [11 U.S.C. § 327(a)];  3. whether the attorney must disclose his co mpensation in the litigation [11 U.S.C.   § 329(a)];  4. whether the attorney may be compensated fr om property of the es tate [11 U.S.C.  § 330(a)(1)];  5. for consumer debtors, what is the scope of  the engagement and what is being charged for  those services [11 U.S.C. § 528(a)];  6. whether the terms of the engagement have  been properly documented [11 U.S.C.   § 528(a)];  7. whether the attorney ha s performed the services promised  [ 11 U.S.C. § 526(a)(1), (2) and (3)];  8. whether an attorney has been involved in investigating whether the debtor has fully and accurately disclosed his assets, their value,  claimed his exemptions and listed his  creditors [11 U.S.C.  § 527(c)]; and 9. whether the debtor has received certain requ ired disclosures from his attorney or  reviewed those disclosures without the assistance of counsel [11 U.S.C. § 342(b)(1),  § 527(a)].   In 2005, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and C onsumer Protection Act of 2005 elevated the  importance of the disclosure of  attorney participation by defining debt relief agencies, adding Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 37 of 44 38  additional duties for counsel for the debtor and authorizing the court to award sanctions under 11 U.S.C. § 526(c) for noncompliance. Without disclo sure of attorney participation, the court will not know whether these provisions are being violated. As the district court noted in United States v. Eleven Vehicles, ﬁ[c]ertain conduct may be sanctionabl e if committed by counsel but not if  committed by a party–. Knowing whether the plead ings were prepared by a lawyer or non- lawyer is therefore important to the administration of justice in the case.ﬂ  United States v. Eleven  Vehicles, 966 F. Supp. at 367; Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011(c)(2)(A). In additio n, the detection of ghostwriting is more problematic in a bankruptcy  proceeding.  Many of the initial pleadings filed  in a bankruptcy case are forms completed with  short answers and numbers . They do not require descriptions of a party™s claims  or defenses that contain citations and legal terminology that  would make the participation of counsel ﬁevident to the tribunal.ﬂ  In re Fengling Liu , 664 F.3d at 370-71.   These bankruptcy administrative and statutor y requirements related to the attorney-client  relationship, coupled with the federal courts™ longstanding concerns about the impact of  ghostwriting on fairness, candor, and compliance w ith the signature requirement of Rule 11 of  the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, lead this court to conclude th at attorney participation in the  preparation of a bankruptcy pleading is a material fact. It is a fact  which is relevant to the proper administration of the bankruptcy law, and it is  a fact that a bankruptcy  judge would consider important in assessing or determining how to pr oceed. As such, it is a material representation  under the TRPC. Any knowing misrep resentation regarding the level of attorney participation is a violation of an attorney™s duty of candor to the tribunal and is a violation of TRPC 8.4(c).

P. 9011     With respect to whether her conduct violated  Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011, the court notes that the rule requires that a pleadi ng be signed by at least one attorney in the individual attorney™s name. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011(a). A party who is  not represented by an attorney shall sign all papers. Id. In this case the petition was signed by the debtors although the court has found that they were represented by counsel. Therefore, they were not the appropriate parties to sign the petition to comply with Rule 9011.    Rule 9011 also requires that a party who pr esents a pleading certify that the pleading being filed is not being submitted for an imprope r purpose. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011(b)(1).  To the  extent that a pleading  is being presented as pro se by the attorney to avoid the obligation of certifying the claims, defenses and other legal  contentions are warranted and that the factual  contentions have evidentiary support, the court  finds such a pleading has been submitted for an  improper purpose. However, Ms. Arthur™s failure  to sign was not based on an attempt to avoid  her obligations with respect to the contentions contained in the Skeleton Filings. Nevertheless,  the submission of the pleadings without he r signature was for an improper purpose;  i.e.,  to file  pleadings before she was authorized to do so.    The court finds no authority in the Sixth Circ uit that the nondisclosure of an attorney™s involvement in the preparation of pl eadings filed with the court is a per se violation of Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011. The court is hesitant to find that ghostwriting is improper under any  circumstance in light of the position take n in the 2007 Formal Opinion, which allows  nondisclosure of the identity of the attorney wher e the attorney is only assisting with a leading  pleading and the scope of services has been appropriately limited.    C.   Sanctions Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 39 of 44 40   Having found that ethical viola tions occurred, the court must  consider what sanctions are appropriate. Sanctions may be imposed by the cour t to compensate other parties and to ensure  compliance with the court™s rules. The UST and  the Trustee contend that  Ms. Arthur™s actions warrant suspension from the practi ce of law in this court.  Wh ile the court agrees that Ms.  Arthur™s actions merit sanctions, the court does  not agree that suspension is appropriate.   Suspension is imposed where there has b een a pattern of conduct which a court has previously ordered to stop or where the continued practice by the attorney is ﬁan immediate  danger to the public.ﬂ  In re Cowan, 620 F.Supp. 2d 867, 873 (E. D. Tenn. 2009).   The UST argues that there is a pattern. He  contends that this is Ms. Arthur™s second violation for practicing without authorization. The court  does not find that the violation involving an unreasonable limitation of the scope of services is part of a  pattern of conduct of the unauthorized practice of law. Ms. Arthur complied with her suspen sion. She did not practice until her six month  suspension had ended. At the time she met with  and advised the debtors, she could practice law in the state of Tennessee.  She simply could not  appear in court or file pleadings until she was reinstated, and that reinstatement was to be au tomatic. She followed thro ugh with the process of reinstatement once she became aware of the requir ement. Since the court does not find that the  violation she committed is part of a pattern of the unauthorized practice of law, the court will not   suspend Ms. Arthur from the practice in this court on the basis of a pattern of unauthorized practice.     A more difficult sanction question concerns Ms.  Arthur™s inappropriate use of the right to  limit her services and whether that conduct poses a  danger to the public.  She directed her clients to represent that th ey were proceeding pro se when she always intended to be their attorney. Ms. Arthur chose to put her clients at risk rather than referring them to  another attorney or associating Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 40 of 44 41  counsel to assist her so that she could provide competent representation.  One of the purposes of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Pr otection Act was to ensure that attorneys  provided the services they promised and put in  writing what those services would be. 11 U.S.C.  §§ 526 (a)(1) and 528(a)(1). Her attempt to limit the scope of her employment was not in  compliance with either of those sections. Becau se this was an unusual set of circumstances  involving the timing of reinstatem ent, the court does not find that this problem is likely to  reoccur; therefore, suspension for  this violation is not required to protect the public.  The court does find that Ms. Arthur needs to be reminded  of her ethical obligations and the appropriate manner of obtaining the informed  consent required for limiting th e scope of employment.  To  that end, the court will order attendance at continuing legal education on professionalism and  ethics.    In addition, Ms. Arthur™s actions required  the court to send deficiency notices for the Skeleton Filings and delayed the 341 meeting fo r Mr. Smith. Two meetings of creditors were  held for each debtor. The debtors had to meet w ith a second bankruptcy attorney and review their information. These were all unnecessary actions that  delayed the process for these two debtors.   The UST and the Trustee are the  parties tasked with monitoring  the operation of the bankruptcy system and chapter 13 cases respectively. They discovered Ms. Arthur™s actions and will be   awarded a judgment to reimburse them for a porti on of their fees and expenses. Ms. Arthur will also be ordered to reimburse any expenses incu rred by Mr. Smith or Ms. Henderson as a result of  having to obtain new counsel or attend multiple meetings of creditors. Ms. Arthur has already   waived her fees in these cases.   The court intends for these sanctions to impress upon Ms. Arthur  the requirements of (1) competency to handle  the representation taken, (2) communication which ensures informed consent and (3) documentati on of the engagement which complies with the  Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 41 of 44 42  Bankruptcy Code. The court anticipates that the total of the mone tary sanctions will be roughly equivalent to the amount Ms. Arthur ch arges for handling one chapter 13 case.   With respect to the violations of her duty  of candor to the tribunal, the court does not find that there was a pattern of conduct of filing ghostw ritten pleadings or that Ms. Arthur knowingly  violated TRPC 1.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 8.4. The misrepre sentations involved the level of her participation in preparation of leading pleadings for these debtors.  She appears to have had a good faith belief that her solution to her filing pr oblem was within the a cceptable parameters of  Tennessee™s position on nondisclosure of her participation. She believed that she would be reinstated before she needed to make a physical  appearance, and she was. As indicated by the court™s lengthy analysis of this area of the law, the ethics rules on disclosure and limited  representation have changed over the last decad e. The courts seem to acknowledge that the  position of each jurisdiction needs to be clarified based on the opinions of the applicable governing body for professional conduct. Even when a court prohibits the practice of  ghostwriting, the courts show some leniency to  the offending attorney whose nondisclosure is first found to be a violation. See, e.g., In re Mungo, 305 B.R. at 770. Under the circumstances of  this case and with respect to the violations of her duty of candor to the court, the court finds that  Ms. Arthur should receive only an admonition fr om the court that nondisclosure of attorney  participation in a bankruptcy proceeding is a violation of her duty of candor to the court.  In the future, the requirement of disclosure  should be clear for any attorney considering whether to ghostwrite pleadings and present them to this court.   If an attorney drafts a pleading for filing with this court, or a ssists a debtor with drafting a pleading or completing the answers to any form knowing that it is going  to be filed with the  court and presented as the debtor™s work, the attorney must be disclose th at assistance. Because the court has found that his or her identity  Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 42 of 44 43  is material to the proper administration of the bankr uptcy case, he or she must also disclose his or her identity.  If the attorney has limited the scope of his or  her representation, the disclosure and participation in the case should be consistent w ith any representation agreement reached with the  client. If there is any limitation of the scope  of bankruptcy representation, the attorney must obtain the informed consent of the client to  the limitation.  The scope of the representation  should be in writing in order to comply w ith the requirements of 11 U.S.C. §§ 526 and 528.  Finally, the attorney should be prepared to demonstrate that th e limitation is reasonable under the  circumstances of the case. To any attorney  considering such limited representation in  bankruptcy, the court recommends th e discussion in Professor Pierce™s article, 41 Tenn. B. J. 22, and the 2005 Tenn. Ethics Opinion, both of which discuss what is an appropriate limitation of  services and how to obtain informed consent.      The court finds that no additional sanctions are appropriate for Ms. Arthur™s violation of   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011. III. CONCLUSION   For the reasons set forth herein, the cour t will GRANT the motions in part and DENY  them in part.  The court finds that there is  clear and convincing evidence that Ms. Arthur committed an ethical violation with respect to the limitation of her services, but does not find   either that the violation is part of a pattern of conduct or that the conduct, under the circumstances of these cases, poses a risk to the  public. The court does not find that there is clear  and convincing evidence that Ms. Arthur knew that her failure to disclose her involvement for a  very brief time violated her duty of candor to  the court in light of the language of the 2007 Formal Opinion. In the absence  of any prior ruling by the Sixth Circuit or this court on the propriety of such conduct, the court will exercise leniency wi th respect to the imposition of  Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 43 of 44 44  sanctions for this violation.  As to any future  filings, the court will cons ider the involvement of  an attorney in the preparation of  a pleading to be presented to this court to be a material fact, and  any misrepresentation regarding that  attorney™s participation or fa ilure to disclose the assistance  of counsel will be considered a violation of th at attorney™s duties of candor to the court.   Accordingly, the court will impose sanctions fo r only the ethical violation of TRPC Rule  1.2(c).  The court will order that (1) Ms. Arthur complete 6 hour s of continuing legal education on ethics and professionalism on or before May  31, 2013; (2) pay attorneys™ fees and expenses up to $1,000 to the UST and $1,000 to the Chapter 13 Trustee; and (3) pay any out-of-pocket  expenses incurred by Mr. Smith or Ms. Henderson  arising from their need to obtain new counsel and attend multiple meetings of creditors, excludi ng the fee paid to substitute counsel. Had she  not already waived her fees, the court would also  have denied Ms. Arthur any compensation for  the work which she performed for these clients.   The Trustee and the UST shall have 14 days  to file a request for fees and expenses. The clerk is directed to send a copy of this Memorandum and the Order filed contemporaneously  herewith to counsel of record for Mr. Smith and Ms. Henderson, and they shall have 28 days  from entry of the order to file  a request for expenses, including, without limitation, their mileage  to attend any additional meetings  of creditors at the same rate  allowed for witnesses under Rule  9016 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.  Ms. Arthur shall have 14 days after service of the request(s) to respond. The court will review the requests and responses and enter an order without further hearing unless the parties request oral argument. Upon receipt of a request for  argument, the court will set the matter for hearing.     A separate order will enter.  # # # Case 1:12-bk-11857-SDR    Doc 114    Filed 01/30/13    Entered 01/30/13 17:33:40    Desc Main Document      Page 44 of 44\n"

This Opinion sets forth the court™s findings of  fact and conclusions of law in support of the Order as follows: JURISDICTION  1. This matter is a core proceeding pursuant  to 28 U.S.C. § 157, and the court has  jurisdiction pursuant to  28 U.S.C. §§ 151, 157, and 1334.  See In re Bernard Hill, Inc. , 133 B.R. 61, 69 (Bankr. D. Md. 1991) (finding  that ﬁ[t]he award of compen sation to professional persons  who render services to a bankruptcy  estate is a ‚core proceeding™ ar ising under title 11 of the United  States Code which bankruptcy judges may hear and determineﬂ).  2. The court has the authority to hear this  matter pursuant to the General Order of  Reference entered August 3, 1984 by the United States  District Court for th e Eastern District of  North Carolina. BACKGROUND  Nature of Debtor™s Business and Events Leading to Chapter 11 Filing  3. The Debtor™s background was summar ized in its Emergency Motion for  Authorization to Use Cash Colla teral filed on November 18, 2015, ex cerpted verbatim as follows:  a. The Debtor is a corporation organize d and existing under the laws of the  State of Rhode Island.  The Debtor™s princi pal place of business is in Wanchese, Dare  County, North Carolina.  The Debtor desi gns and manufactures luxury performance  cruising catamarans under the GUNBOAT brand.   The Debtor was founded and has been  in business for over fifteen years, when shar eholder Peter Johnstone [ﬁJohnstoneﬂ] decided  to redesign the sailboat, combining comfort  and race boat technology, resulting in the first  GUNBOAT model, the TRIBE in 2001, a catam aran built for both speed and long voyage ocean cruising.  Since the introduction of th e TRIBE in 2001, the Debtor has expanded the  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 2 of 31 3  GUNBOAT brand to include the  40™, 55™, 65™, 72™, and 77™ se ries, and has its first 78™ series yacht in production.   In 2015, Cruising World named the Gunboat 55 the ﬁDomestic  Boat of the Yearﬂ in its 2015  Boat of the Year competitio n.  The Debtor™s operations  [employed] approximately 57 employees [inv olved] in the design, construction, and  manufacture of the yachts and fi nancial affairs of the Debtor. b. The Debtor began to experience financ ial problems as a result of cost  overruns in the manufacture of  its 55 foot series, with the co sts for design and manufacture  of the first yachts produced in this series exceeding the sale price for some of the yachts   under construction.  While later yachts in the 55  foot series were prof itable, the Debtor was  unable to recoup sufficient proceeds from the la ter 55 foot yachts to offset the earlier 55  foot models.  This led to the termination of se veral contracts that were  in various stages of  production.  During this same time, the Debtor wa s forced to file a lawsuit against one of  its boat manufacturers for defects in the ma nufacturing process and failure to honor the  contractual warranty requirements.  This cau sed the Debtor to expend substantial funds  making repairs and honoring these warranties.   The Debtor also  had one yacht suffer  damage during a test/photo shoot by a leading yacht magazine, resulting in negative   publicity for the GUNBOAT brand.  4. In mid-summer 2015, the Debtor consulted with the Firm for the purpose of  structuring a workout of it s financial crisis, including the possibility of filing a bankruptcy petition.   The Firm spent several months analyzing and asse ssing the Debtor™s situ ation, preparing for an anticipated Chapter 11 proceeding, and assi sting with various contract disputes.  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 3 of 31 4  Filing of Petition and Employment of the Firm  5. Through the Firm, the Debtor filed a volunt ary petition (ﬁPetitionﬂ) for relief under  Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code  (ﬁCodeﬂ) on November 18, 2015 and is operating  as a debtor-in-possession pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 1107. 1 6. On December 17, 2015, the Debtor filed  an Application for Employment of  Attorney (ﬁEmployment Applicatio nﬂ), requesting the court to a pprove the Debtor™s employment  of the Firm as counsel pursuant to § 327(a).   In an affidavit attached to the Employment  Application, the Firm disclosed that at the time  the Debtor™s Petition was filed, the Debtor owed  the Firm $12,137.75 (ﬁPre-petition Debt ﬂ) in fees and expenses associated with preparations for  filing the Debtor™s Chapter 11  proceeding and incurred between November 2, 2105 and November  18, 2015, the date the Petition was filed.  A detail of the Pre-petition Debt is as follows: Attorneys™ Fees (ﬁPre-petition Feesﬂ):   Billed Fees     $ 27,216.00    Credit issued by the Firm (ﬁCreditﬂ) 2      (6,975.00)           $ 20,241.00  Expenses (ﬁPre-petition Expensesﬂ)          Chapter 11 Filing Fee         1,717.00    Copying, Postage, etc.            179.75                1,896.75  Total (ﬁPre-petition Chargesﬂ)     $ 22,137.75   Less Pre-petition Payment        (10,000.00)  Pre-petition Debt       $ 12,137.75    7. The BA objected to the Employment Applic ation, asserting that  the Firm was not  disinterested as required by § 327( a).  The BA contended that th e outstanding Pre-petition Debt made the Firm a creditor of the Debtor at the tim e of the Petition and, therefore, not disinterested  as defined by § 101(14)(A).                                                  1 Further references to the United States Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 101  et seq. , other than formal  citations, shall be by section number only.  2 The Firm did not provide the court with any explana tion as to why it chose to issue the Credit or how the  amount of the Credit was calculated.

On January 27, 2016, the court entered an  Order Allowing Employment of Attorney  (ﬁEmployment Orderﬂ).  In appr oving the Debtor™s employment of  the Firm, the court relied upon  its previous determination that a  debtor™s attorney is disinteres ted under § 327(a) if a pre-petition  debt owed by the debtor is ﬁrela tively modest, traceable temporally to a short period of time before  filing, and confined to activi ties surrounding preparation of  the petition and accompanying  papersŠthe bare-bone, routine, a nd necessary services for filing.ﬂ  In re Duffus & Associates, P.A. , Case No. 05-03886-8-JRL (Bankr. E. D.N.C. Aug. 8, 2005).  The co urt directed that the Pre- petition Charges be included with the Debtor™s firs t application for approval of attorneys™ fees and  expenses, at which time the BA would have an oppor tunity to object to any fees or expenses that  do not specifically relate to  the Debtor™s Chapter 11 filing. Chapter 11 Proceeding  9. According to the Debtor™s Schedules filed on November 30, 2015, at the time of  the Petition, the Debtor owned assets va lued at $1,141,168.36 and was liable for secured and  unsecured debts totaling $15,574,422.16. 10. Contemporaneous with the Petition, the  Debtor filed an Emergency Motion for  Authorization to Use Cash Collateral.  The court approved the Debtor™s use of cash collateral on   an interim basis subject to the Debtor making certain  payments such as payroll, insurance, and rent  for its business premises.  3  The Debtor quickly had trouble  meeting these obligations, and on  December 23, 2015, the Debtor filed an Emergency  Motion for Authorization to Enter Into and  Obtain Post-Petition Secured Credit Transa ction Pursuant to §§  105(a), 363(b) and 364(c),  pursuant to which the Debtor re quested approval of a transacti on (ﬁDIP Financing Transactionﬂ)                                                   3 The court™s approval initially came from the Interim Or der Authorizing Debtor™s Use of Cash Collateral  Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 363 entered on November 20, 2015, with second and third interim orders respectively entered  on December 17, 2015  and January 28, 2016.  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 5 of 31 6  with Johnstone.  Under the DIP Financing Tran saction, Johnstone would extend credit to the  Debtor up to $150,000.00, secured by a blanket lien on id entified assets of the Debtor, to facilitate  the Debtor™s compliance with the interim orders au thorizing its use of cash collateral.  On January  28, 2016, the court entered an Order Authorizing Po st-Petition Financing which approved the DIP  Financing Transaction.  Subsequently, on Februa ry 4, 2016, the court entered an Order Approving  Budget that authorized the Debtor™s continued use of cash collateral. 11. The most significant event and accomp lishment of the Debtor™s Chapter 11  proceeding came as a result the Debtor™s determinati on that a sale of its assets was in the best  interest of the estate.  With the assistance of  the Firm, the Debtor esta blished an extensive but  orderly bidding procedure for the sale of the assets.  On  May 10, 2016, after several months of  negotiations between the De btor and affected parties, the c ourt entered a Final Order Approving Sale of Property of the Esta te Under Bankruptcy Code § 363 a nd the Assumption and Assignment  of Executory Contracts and Leases Under Bankruptcy Code § 365 which,  inter alia, approved a sale (ﬁAsset Saleﬂ) of the bulk of the Debtor™s assets pursuant to § 363.4 12. In addition to obtaining approval of  the DIP Financing Transaction and the immense undertaking of facilitating  the Asset Sale for the benefit of the estate, the Firm assisted  the Debtor with numerous other  matters arising within the Chap ter 11 proceeding including, but  not limited to, obtaining orders authorizing  payment of pre-petition wages and officer  compensation; defending motions for relief fr om the automatic stay; assuming and rejecting  certain unexpired leases and executory contract s; managing collateral litigation in which the                                                   4 Also on May 10, 2016, the court entered two additional orders respectively approving sales of certain assets  that were excluded from the Asset Sale ; however, the court recently  set aside the Final Order Approving the Sale of  Assets Free and Clear of A ll Liens, Claims, and Encumbrances to John Chen.

Committee of Unsecured Creditors  13. On December 17, 2015, the court entere d an Order Appointing Committee of  Unsecured Creditors, which appointed named cr editors holding unsecured claims to the  Committee pursuant to § 1102.  On January 19, 2016,  the court entered an Order Authorizing  Payment and Retention of Parker Poe Adams & Be rnstein LLP as Counsel  for Official Committee  of Unsecured Creditors which authorized the Co mmittee to employ Parker Poe Adams & Bernstein  LLP (ﬁParker Poeﬂ) as counsel pursuant to § 1103. 14. The Committee, through Parker  Poe, has been active in al l phases of the Debtor™s  bankruptcy proceeding and has claimed it was signi ficantly involved in nego tiations leading up to  the Asset Sale.  On April 6, 2016, Parker Poe file d an application for allowance of compensation  in the amount of $63,552.00 and reimbursement of  expenses in the amount of $1,866.31 incurred  between December 11, 2015 and February 29, 2016.  On May 9, 2016, the court entered an order  allowing payment to Parker Poe of the requested  fees and expenses in the total amount of  $65,418.31. Hudson Yacht Litigation 15. At the time of the Petition, the Debtor wa s a plaintiff in a civil action (ﬁHudson  Yacht Actionﬂ) against Hudson Yacht & Marine  Systems, Inc. and Hudson Wang (collectively  Hudson Yacht Defendantsﬂ) pending in the United Stat es District Court for  the District of Rhode  Island.  In the Hudson Yacht Action, the Debtor  is seeking compensatory  damages against the  Hudson Yacht Defendants for breach of contract , fraudulent inducement,  interference with  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 7 of 31 8  contractual relations, and unjust enrichment.  The Hudson Yacht De fendants deny liability to the  Debtor and have asserted counterclaims against  the Debtor for breach of  contract and defamation.  16. On January 13, 2016, upon motion of the Debtor , the United States District Court  for the District of Rhode Island entered an Or der transferring the Hudson Yacht Action to the  United States District Court for  Eastern District of North Caro lina pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404  ﬁin the interest of justiceﬂ and  ﬁfor the convenience  of the parties.ﬂ  On  February 15, 2016, the  United States District Court for the Eastern Dist rict of North Carolina entered an Order referring  the Hudson Yacht Action to this court as being  ﬁrelated toﬂ the Debto r™s Chapter 11 proceeding  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 157 and, therefore, subject  to the General Order of Reference.  The Hudson  Yacht Action is currently pending in this co urt as Adversary Proceeding No. 16-00015-5-DMW.  Fee Application and Objection 17. In the Application, the Firm requests allowance of attorneys™ fees and expenses  totaling $229,114.14.  This total includes the Pre-petition Charges of $22,137.75 which consists  of the Pre-petition Fees of $20,241.00 and the  Pre-petition Expenses of $1,896.75.  The balance  of $206,976.39 (ﬁPost-petition Chargesﬂ) consists  of $200,414.00 (ﬁPost-petition Feesﬂ) in fees  plus $6,562.39 (ﬁPost-petition Expensesﬂ) in expenses  incurred after the Petition.  Attached to the  Application are two exhibits respectively containi ng invoices setting forth  the Pre-petition Charges (ﬁPre-petition Invoicesﬂ) and the Post-petition Ch arges (ﬁPost-petition Invoicesﬂ) (collectively  referred to as ﬁInvoicesﬂ). 18. The BA first objects to the Pre-petition F ees as being outside the scope of the  holding in the  Duffus case referenced in the Employment Orde r.  The BA asserts that the following  services performed by the Firm are not sufficiently  related to the prepar ation and filing of the  Petition to prevent the Firm from being disinteres ted within the meaning of  § 327:  preparation of Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 8 of 31 9  a leasehold deed of trust; respondi ng to pending litigation; contract  negotiations; and drafting of a  note and security agreement.  19. The BA also asserts that the Pre-petition  Invoices contain ﬁlumped time entries,ﬂ  thereby suggesting that the Pre-petition Invoices  do not conform to the ﬁProcedures for Preparing  and Submitting Applications for Compensation  by Professionalsﬂ contained within the BA™s  Chapter 11 Administrative Guid e (as revised October 1, 2015).5  The BA contends that the lumped  nature of the time entries prevent her from being  able to accurately determine what amount of the  Pre-petition Fees directly relates to the filing of the Petition; theref ore, all of the Pre-petition Fees  should be denied. 20. In addressing the sizeable amount of Po st-petition Fees, the BA acknowledges that  the members of the Firm are experienced and ta lented bankruptcy professionals, and she does not object to their individual hour ly rates which range from $95.00 to $135.00 for paralegals and  $225.00 to $450.00 for attorneys.  Rather, the BA alleges that the Post-petition Fees are generally duplicative in nature and unreasonably excessive, es pecially when taking into account the fees  allowed Parker Poe for representation of the  Committee and awards made in similar cases.   Specifically, the BA raises the following concerns about the Post-petition Fees: a. The Firm billed 63.10 hours, totaling $18,930.00 in fees, for time spent in  connection with the transfer  of the Hudson Yacht Litigation  from Rhode Island to North  Carolina;                                                   5 This manual provides that ﬁ[t]o the  extent possible, separate time entr ies shall be made for each service Œ  time entries should not be ‚lumped™ together.  The practice  of lumping several different tasks together is discouraged  as it often makes it difficult to separate  compensable and non-compensable items.ﬂ  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 9 of 31 10  b. The Firm billed 34.40 hours in matte rs related to the Hudson Yacht  Litigation, exclusive of the transfer in ve nue and which included $4,132.00 of fees incurred  by two attorneys attending a preliminary mediation; and  c. Stubbs billed 92.70 hours in post-petition fees, and it appears that 52.80  hours of this time are duplica tive services rendered by ot her members of the Firm,  particularly Laurie B. Biggs (ﬁBiggsﬂ), the ap parent lead attorney in the Debtor™s case.   Stubbs billed 16.5 hours for attending court hear ings where another member of the Firm  was also present.   21. At the Hearing, Biggs and Wendy Karam (ﬁ Karamﬂ), a paralegal for the Firm,  testified in support of the Appli cation.  The Firm also introduced  into evidence numerous exhibits  which provide various breakdowns a nd analyses of the compensation  sought in the Application.   At the conclusion of the Hearing, the court gran ted the Application and orally summarized its  findings of facts and conclusions  of law in support of its decisi on and which are more fully set  forth in this Opinion. DISCUSSION  22. As suggested by the title of the Applic ation, the Firm makes its request for  allowance of attorneys™ fees and expenses pu rsuant to § 503(b).  This section allows an  administrative expense for ﬁcompensation and re imbursement awarded under section 330(a) of  this title.ﬂ 11 U.S.C. § 503(b)(2).  Section 330(a)(1) provides as follows: (1) After notice to the parties in interest and the [Bankruptcy  Administrator] and a hearing, and subject  to sections 326, 3 28, and 329, the court  may award to a trustee, a consumer privacy ombudsman appointed under section   332, an examiner, an ombudsman appointed  under section 333, or a professional  person employed under section 327 or 1103Š    (A) reasonable compensation for actual, necessary services  rendered by the trustee, examiner, ombudsman, professional person, or  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 10 of 31 11  attorney and by any paraprofessional person employed by any such person;  and   (B) reimbursement for actual, necessary expenses.   11 U.S.C. § 330(a)(1).  The App lication would have been more  properly brought under § 330(a)  in addition to § 503(b), because unless and unti l compensation and reimbursement are awarded  under § 330(a), they cannot be allowed as administrative expenses. 6 23. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (ﬁFourth Circuitﬂ)  historically requires courts re viewing an application for compensation under § 330(a) to combine  a ﬁlodestarﬂ analysis with detailed findings on  the following twelve relevant factors (the ﬁ Johnson Factorsﬂ) established by the United States  Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit:  (1) the time and labor expended; (2) the  novelty and difficulty of the questions  raised; (3) the skill required to properly pe rform the legal services rendered; (4) the  attorney™s opportunity costs in pressing the instant litigation; (5) the customary fee  for like work; (6) the attorney™s expectati ons at the outset of the litigation; (7) the  time limitations imposed by the client or circumstances; (8) the amount in   controversy and the results obtained; (9)  the experience, reputation and ability of  the attorney; (10) the undesirability of th e case within the legal community in which  the suit arose; (11) the nature and lengt h of the professional relationship between  the attorney and client; and (12) attorneys™ fees awards in similar cases.

In the Memorandum, the Firm asserts that ﬁthe fees and expenses sought  in the Application are reasonable and should be approved pursuant to 11 U.S.C. §§ 330, 331, and 503(b) of the   Bankruptcy Code.ﬂ  Section 331 simply authorizes the allowance of interim compensation during the pendency of a  case.

Subsequent to the Fourth Circuit™s adoption of the  Johnson Factors, the Bankruptcy  Reform Act of 1994 and the Bankruptcy Abuse Pr evention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005  amended § 330 to include a non-exhaus tive list of factors that a bankr uptcy court must consider in  determining reasonable compensation to  be awarded a professional person: (3) In determining the amount of reasonable compensation to be  awarded to an examiner, trustee under chap ter 11, or professional person, the court  shall consider the nature, the extent, and the value of such services, taking into   account all relevant factors, including Š  (A) the time spent on such services;  (B) the rates charged for such services;  (C) whether the services were nece ssary to the administration of,  or beneficial at the time at which the service was rendered toward the   completion of, a case  under this title;   (D) whether the services were performed within a reasonable  amount of time commensurate with the complexity, importance, and nature   of the problem, issue, or task addressed;  (E) with respect to a professional  person, whether the person is  board certified or otherwise has demonstrated skill and experience in the   bankruptcy field; and   (F) whether the compensation is reasonable based on the  customary compensation charged by comparably skilled practitioners in   cases other than cases under this title.   11 U.S.C. § 330(a)(3) (emphasis added).  This subs ection instructs the court to take into account  all relevant factors; therefore, ﬁin addition to [the  Johnson Factors], any other factors enumerated  within Section 330(a)(3) of the Code that affect  the reasonableness of hourly rates must also be  considered.ﬂ In re Brier Creek Corp.

BAP 2000)) (emphasis added).  26. The Application™s inclusion of the Pre- petition Charges complicates the court™s  review under §330(a), because these charges relate  to ﬁservices rendered to the debtor, as the  debtor-in-possession does not come into  existence until the petition is filed.ﬂ  In re Four Star  Terminals, Inc. , 42 B.R. 419, 432 (Bankr. D. Alaska 1984) .  Section 330(a) does not expressly  include awards for compensation and reimbursement  incurred pre-petition;  but this concept is  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 13 of 31 14  inherent, because a court™ s award under § 330(a) is  subject to  § 329.  Section 329 allows the court  to review fees paid or agreed to by paid pre-petiti on by a debtor to an attorney and states as follows:  (a) Any attorney representing a debtor in a case under this title, or in  connection with such a case, whether or not  such attorney applies for compensation  under this title, shall file w ith the court a statement of the compensation paid or  agreed to be paid, if such  payment or agreement was made  after one year before the  date of the filing of the petition, for services rendered or to be rendered  in contemplation of or in  connection with the case  by such attorney, and the source of  such compensation.    (b) If such compensation exceeds the reasonable value of any such  services, the court may cancel any such agreement , or order the return of any such   payment, to the extent excessive, to   (1) the estate if the property transferredŠ   (A) would have been property of the estate; or   (B) was to be paid by or on be half of the debtor under a  plan under chapter 11, 12, or 13 of this title; or  (2) the entity that made such payment.    11 U.S.C. § 329 (emphasis added).  Considerin g §§ 329 and 330 in tandem, § 330(a) allows for  consideration of compensation for services rendered  pre-petition provided th at such services meet  § 329™s requirement of being  in contemplation of or in connection with the case. 27. The standard for review under § 329 is limited to the  reasonableness of an  attorney™s charges and does not include  the more heightened standards of  actual and necessary  contained within § 330.  Under  § 329 alone, reasonable attorneys™  fees incurred pre-petition can  only be allowed as a general unsecured claim agains t the estate; however, § 330(a) integrates fees that meet its increased  standards of review and scrutiny.  Th e United States Court of Appeals for  the Ninth Circuit explained that  ﬁ[a] proper construction of the  bankruptcy fee statute allows  compensation under the administrative expense provi sion of section 330 for only those ‚actual,  necessary services™ rendered by the debtor™s atto rney ‚in contemplation of  and in connection with™  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 14 of 31 15  the bankruptcy case.ﬂ Yermakov v. Fitzsimmons (In re Yermakov) , 718 F.2d 1465, 1472 (9th Cir.  1983) (quoting 11 U.S.C. §§ 329(a), 330(a)(1)). Pre-petition Charges 28. Turning to the merits of the Application,  the Pre-petition Charges must be reviewed  in two stages.  First, as stated by the court  in the Employment Order, any amounts owed by the  Debtor to the Firm at the time of the Petition must be sufficiently related to the initiation of the   Debtor™s bankruptcy proceeding to satisfy the di sinterestedness requirement of § 327.  To the  extent that any of the Pre-petition Charges do not meet this threshold, then the Firm must waive   those charges.  Pre-petition Char ges that do sufficiently relate to  the filing of the Petition and  commencement of the case must then be reviewed under §§ 329 and 330 to be allowed as an   administrative expense against the Debtor™s estate.  29. In the  Duffus case referenced in the Employment Order, the debtor was an  incorporated law firm that was winding down its pract ice after the death of its  principal attorney.   During this process, the debtor™s counsel was essen tially wearing two hats:  attorney for the debtor   as well as attorney for the debtor™s clients with ma tters pending at the time of  the principal™s death.   In reviewing the pre-petition ch arges included within the debt or™s counsel™s application for  approval of compensation and reimbursement  of expenses, the court found that [m]any of the fees are tied to  closing out the debtor™s cas es, arranging for the pick-up of office equipment and furniture, and ot her tasks associated with the winding  down of the debtor.  While the court does  not question the validity and quality of  the work performed by counsel, seeking co mpensation for such pre-petition debt  flies in the face of the disinterested requirement.  Such debt falls outside the limited   scope of ﬁactivities surrounding prepara tion of the petition and accompanying  papers.ﬂ   In re Duffus & Associates, P.A. , Case No. 05-03886-8-JRL (Bankr. E.D.N.C. Nov. 30, 2005). Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 15 of 31 16  30. The BA argues that the Pre-petition Fees  being requested by the Firm fall outside  the scope of the  Duffus disinterestedness standard, because  many of the time entries contained in  the Pre-petition Invoices are not di rectly related to preparing th e Petition and its accompanying  motions for use of cash collateral and payment of pre-petition wages.   The court disagrees, and as noted at the Hearing, finds  Duffus to be a start, not a boundary.  Initiating a bankruptcy proceeding,  especially a complex Chapter 11 case, involves far  more than physically preparing the initial forms  and motions.  Attorneys represen ting an inevitable bankruptcy de btor are required to undertake  many important tasks in the days and weeks preceding the filing.  Many of these tasks promote the   efficient and successful administration of the case.  While  Duffus correctly excludes compensation  for the day-to-day and routine corporate counsel of a going concern, a bankruptcy attorney should   not ignore tending to collateral matters that could ne gatively impact the eventual bankruptcy estate.   31. Carrying Duffus to a logical conclusion, the pre-peti tion services must have a nexus  to the bankruptcy filing.  Interpreting the ne xus can be done on a spectrum of liberal to  conservative.  If interpreted liberally, almost no  unpaid pre-petition service that counsel performs  for a potential debtor would prevent disinterestedne ss.  Contrarily, if interpreted conservatively,  then only the unpaid fees for the most fundamental  tasks relating to the prep aration of th e petition, schedules and statement of financial affairs can  support a finding of disint erestedness.  The more  appropriate method is the applicat ion of a logical and temporal ne xus interpretation.  In order for  counsel to be disinterested, the unpaid pre-petition  services must have a l ogical relationship to the  bankruptcy filing but must be done sufficiently close  in time to the bankruptcy filing.  For example,  advising a debtor on a reduction in  employees six months from the pe tition date may have a logical  nexus but not a temporal one.  Preparing an em ployee handbook for the debtor the month before  the filing has a temporal nexus  but not a logical one.  Prepari ng a consulting agreement for a  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 16 of 31 17  financial advisor three months prio r to the filing has neither a logi cal nor a temporal nexus to the  filing.  32. In reviewing the Pre-petition Invoices,  the BA and the court had concerns and  questions about the following pre-petition services: a. Time entry dated November 3, 2015:   ﬁPreparation of Leasehold Deed of  Trust.ﬂ  This entry was not addressed by either  Biggs or Karam, and  the court believes it  relates to a pre-petition s ublease entered into between the Debtor and Warship, LLC,  whereby the Debtor subleased its business pr emises in Wanchese, North Carolina.  The  Pre-petition Invoices reflect that the fees related to this time entry are $148.50.  b. Time entry dated November 4, 2015: ﬁReview motion for summary  judgment of Ihre Supply.ﬂ  Biggs explaine d in her testimony that the Debtor was a  defendant in an acti on initiated by Ih re Supply in Wilson Count y, North Carolina, and a  motion for summary judgment against the De btor was pending in the case.  The Firm  reviewed Ihre Supply™s motion for the purpose  of ensuring that a pr e-petition judgment  was not entered against the Debtor, because su ch judgment would require the Firm to take  costly post-petition action to avoid the j udgment under applicable bankruptcy laws.  The  total fees attributed  to this time entry plus other lu mped entries are $937.50.  The Firm™s  ﬁExhibit 8ﬂ7 admitted into evidence at the Hearing s uggests that the amount of these fees  related to the questionable time entry are $468.75.  c. Time entry dated November 9, 2015:  ﬁReview or, revisions to, and  finalization of Answer and Defenses to Paxton  Co. lawsuit and cover letter for same, and  filing of the foregoing.ﬂ  Biggs testified that  the Debtor was also a defendant in an action                                                   7 Exhibit 8 is a copy of the Pre-petiti on Invoices with marginal notes presumably made by Biggs that appear  to specify the amount of fees attributable to certain questionable time entries.   Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 17 of 31 18  pending in Virginia, and for reasons similar to  the action taken with respect to the Ihre  Supply matter, the Firm filed an answer in th is action to prevent a default judgment from  being entered against the Debtor.  The Pre-peti tion Invoices reflect that  the fees related to  this time entry are $90.00.  d. Time entry dated November 10, 2015:   ﬁReview draft note and security  agreement . . . .ﬂ  In the Objection, the BA speculated that this entry related to loan   documents prepared to secure payment of  administrative expenses incurred after the  Petition.  Although this transaction that  was ultimately disallowed by the court, 8 the  documents were certainly prepared with the minds et of protecting the estate.  This entry is  lumped with another matter for total fees of  $360.00; however, Exhibit 8 attributes only  $90.00 to the review of the draft note and security agreement.  e. Time entry dated November 13, 2015:   ﬁReview email from Lynn [sic]  Dolan Re: Answer to counterclaim and prep aration of email to Lynn [sic] Dolan Re:  Same.ﬂ  Biggs advised the court that Lynne Dolan (ﬁDolanﬂ) is an attorney licensed in  Rhode Island who was representing the Debtor  in the Hudson Yacht Litigation, and that  the due date for an answer to counterclaims a sserted against the Debtor dictated the date  for filing the Petition.  This time entry is lu mped with extensive other entries, including  meetings with the Debtor™s principal and revi ews of the Petition and related matters.  The  total fees for these lumped entries are $3,600.00;  however, Exhibit 8 attributes only $75.00  to the communication with Dolan.  33. Based upon its review of the Pre-petition Invoices in light of Biggs™ testimony, the court concludes that all  of the Pre-petition Fees appropriately  fall within the logical and temporal                                                   8 Based upon concerns expressed by the court at hearing, the Debtor withdrew its request for allowance of  the proposed administrative claims financing transaction.  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 18 of 31 19  nexus of activities relate d to the preparation for and filing  of the Petition.  When the Debtor  retained the Firm, the Debtor was litigating several contract disputes in different venues.    Evaluating the posture of these actions was nece ssary to determine the appropriate financial  strategy for the Debtor.  Once the decision was  made to seek bankruptcy protection, the Firm  prudently did not ignore issues and deadlines within  these actions that could affect the Debtor™s  bankruptcy estate.  The court rec ognizes the Firm for its professi onalism in defending the Debtor  until the automatic stay imposed  by § 362 was invoked by the Petition.  34. Even if some of the Pre-petition Fees do  not sufficiently relate  to the Petition, the  court notes that the total value of the fees for the disputed entries described above, even including lumped entries, is $5,136.00 which is less than  the Credit of $6,975.00 given by the Firm pre- petition. 35. Addressing the BA™s objection to the lumped  nature of the Pre-petition Invoices,  the court agrees that time entries contained with in the Pre-petition Invoices are not as succinctly  categorized as the time entries in the Post -petition Invoices.  At the Hearing, the court  contemplated requiring the Firm to separate the lu mped entries to aid the court™s review; however,  after hearing Biggs™ testimony, the court concluded  that task was not necessary, especially taking  into account the Credit. 36. The BA did not object to the Pre-petition  Expenses, the majority of which was the  Chapter 11 filing fee  in the amount of $1,717.00.  The rema ining $179.75 resulted from copy  expenses directly related to  the preparation of the Petition and accompanying motions and  schedules. 37. The court holds that none of the outstandi ng Pre-petition Charges prevents the Firm  from being disinterested under § 327; therefore,  the Firm need not waive any of the Pre-petition  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 19 of 31 20  Charges.  The Firm points out that the issue of  examining the scope of outstanding pre-petition  fees can be avoided by simply f iling an accelerated petition and leaving the tangential matters for  addressing post-petition, but this rush of action is often not in the best interest of either the debtor or its creditors.  The court agrees; however, by fi nding that the Firm is disinterested, the court is  not condoning bankruptcy attorneys routinely filing pe titions prior to being  paid for pre-petition  services.  As previously stated  by this court, ﬁcounsel in this  District should rarely invoke the  services in preparation and in  anticipation of filing the petition doctrine to be qualified as  disinterested.  The preferred practic e in this District is for all pre-petition services prior to filing to  be paid prior to the time of  filing the Chapter 11 petition.ﬂ In re Premiere Ente rprises of Whiteville,  LLC, Case No. 13-04639-8-RDD, 2 013 WL 5907790 at *3 (Bankr. E. D.N.C. Nov. 4, 2013).  In  other words, the final pre-petition invoice should  be generated and paid prior to filing the voluntary  petition.  Following this procedure would alleviate the uncertainly of fee and expense scrutiny by the BA, creditors, and this court.  38. Having found the Firm disinterested, the  court must now determine what amount  of the Pre-petition Charges can be considered fo r allowance as an administrative expense.  As  explained supra, pre-petition fees and expenses consider ed under § 330(a) are  subject to § 329 and  its limitation that the charges be in contempl ation of or in connection with the case.  See, e.g. , Four Star Terminals , 42 B.R. at 432 (allowing a Chapter 11 debt or™s counsel an administrative expense  claim pursuant to §§ 329 and 330 for pre-petition f ees related to background research regarding  the debtor™s financial condition; meetings with the debtor™s representatives; and preparing the   petition, statements, and schedules).  This re quirement is coincidentally similar to the  Duffus standard as expanded by this Opin ion; therefore, for th e reasons set forth in support of the Firm™s  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 20 of 31 21  disinterestedness, the court also  finds that all of the Pre-petition  Charges are ripe for consideration  under § 330(a) along with the Post-petition Charges. Lodestar and Johnson Factors Analysis 39. ﬁThe bankruptcy court has a duty to examine  all applications for attorney™s fees.   This duty exists even in the absence of objecti ons, and when objections are raised the court™s  review is not limited to the items in controversy.ﬂ  In re Watson Seafood & Poultry Co., Inc. , 40 B.R. 436, 438 (Bankr. E.D.N.C.  1984) (citations omitted).  The court thoroughly examined the  Application and attached Invoices,  with special attention given to  the issues raised in the BA™s  Objection. 40. The court must now consider the Pre-peti tion Fees and the Post-petition Fees  (collectively ﬁFeesﬂ) taking into account the  Johnson  Factors, which are easier to state than they  are to apply. Id.  The Fourth Circuit requires the court to first ascertain the nature and  extent of the services supplied by the attorney from a  statement showing the number of hours wo rked and an explanation of how these  hours were spent.  The court should next  determine the customary hourly rate of  compensation.  These are essentially  Johnson factors 1 and 5.  The court should  then multiply the number of hours reasonably expended by the customary hourly   rate to determine an initial amount for  the fee award.  Finally, the court should  adjust the fee on the basis of the other fact ors, briefly explaining how they affected  the award.    Id. (quoting Anderson v. Morris, 658 F.2d 246, 249 (4th Cir. 1981)). 41. The lodestar amount for the Fees is $ 220,655.00 which consists of the following: Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 21 of 31 22  Hours Hourly Rate Fees 595.00 $            475.00 $           216.5135.00 $          29,227.50 $      4.7225.00 $          1,057.50 $        63.4300.00 $          19,020.00 $      3250.00 $          750.00 $           12275.00 $          3,300.00 $        34.4350.00 $          12,040.00 $      297.2375.00 $          111,450.00 $    111.8450.00 $          50,310.00 $      227,630.00$    (6,975.00) $       220,655.00$         Total Fees      Less Credit  Following the format set forth in  Watson Seafood & Poultry, the court addresses each of the  Johnson Factors as follows: a. The Time and Labor Expended :  This first  Johnson Factor is the heart of the  BA™s Objection to the Application and parall els § 330(a)(3)(A)™s ma ndate that the court  consider the time spent on servic es.  The BA contends that th e overall time spent on matters  in this case is excessive and includes dup licative efforts by the  various professionals  employed by the Firm.  The court recognizes th at the Firm invested a significant amount  of time in this case, and there are several occa sions when more than  one attorney conducted  research on a matter, participat ed in a conference, or attende d a hearing.  At the time the  Application was filed, the case was less than six months old.   During this short time period,  the Firm encountered a plethora of issu es, both routine and complex, and the court  conducted hearings on approximately a dozen different dates, with several matters often   scheduled together.  Biggs™ testimony at the  Hearing addressed the BA™s specific concerns  about the time and labor expended by the Firm as follows:  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 22 of 31 23  i.  The BA objected to entries co ntained within the Pre-petition  Invoices that reflected both Stubbs and  Biggs and sometimes Karam participating  in conferences with officers of the Debtor .  The BA specifically referenced over 24  hours being billed on November 13, 2015 in  connection with a conference with  Johnstone attended by Stubbs in person and  Biggs and Karam via telephone.  Biggs  identified this conference as critical to  obtaining necessary information about the  Debtor™s business, assets, and liabilities,  and Biggs considered the participation of  each professional essential.  While Stubbs  was more concerned with the overall  operations of the Debtor™s business and  Chapter 11 procedural strategies, Biggs  was gathering information needed for fi rst day motions, and Karam was obtaining  all the data needed for the Petition, sc hedules, and statements, which she was  preparing in ﬁreal-timeﬂ during the meeting.  ii. Biggs explained that in other instances when more than one attorney  participated in a conference, it was often si mply more efficient for each attorney to  hear first-hand the vast and complex amount  of information being discussed rather  than for one attorney to participate and then subsequently attempt to convey   adequately the information.  Also, differe nt attorneys handle different matters  within the Debtor™s case, and what informa tion is most important to each attorney  varies.  Similarly, more than one attorney  was often needed at hearings where the  court was considering multiple issues eith er within a single matter or dispersed  among several matters calendared together.  iii. In addressing the time spent on  the removal of the Hudson Yacht  Action from Rhode Island to this court,  Biggs admitted that there was a slight  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 23 of 31 24  duplication of legal research between two  attorneys that in hindsight was probably not necessary, and Biggs attributed appr oximately $700.00 of fees  related to this  duplication.  Biggs pointed out, however, that  the two attorneys  assigned to oversee  the removal each have lower hourly rates than she.  iv. Also with respect to  the Hudson Yacht Acti on, the BA suggested  that it was excessive and premature for Biggs  and another attorney to participate in  a mediation, because the parties had not  yet engaged in formal discovery.  Biggs  contended that this mediation was extr emely productive and provided both her and  the other attending attorney, a litigation specialist, with an opportunity to meet the  Hudson Yacht Defendants face-to-face and determine the strengths and weaknesses  of this case, which was previously ha ndled by out-of-state  counsel.  While the  mediation did result in an immediate se ttlement of the Huds on Yacht Action, Biggs  nevertheless considered the time spent useful in that it helped them develop case  strategies for going forward.9 v. Biggs acknowledged that she is the  primary attorney responsible for  the day-to-day oversight of the Debtor™s  case; however, she di d not agree with the  BA that she was the sole ﬁlead attorney,ﬂ making the time billed by Stubbs   unnecessarily duplicative.  Biggs contended  that this case was far more than she  could handle alone, and she relied on the c ontinual assistance and guidance of the  more-seasoned Stubbs.  Biggs also poi nted out that Stubbs was primarily                                                   9 On July 7, 2016, the parties to the Hudson Yacht Action filed a Consent Motion for Extension of Time to  Answer Complaint which indicates that the parties have r eached a settlement and are finalizing the details of that  settlement.  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 24 of 31 25  responsible for several matters within  the case such as the DIP Financing  Transaction.  b. The Novelty and Difficulty  of the Questions Raised :  In this case, the Firm  faced issues beyond what is generally encounte red in the typical Chapter 11 proceeding.   For example, the Debtor was a party to severa l lawsuits that involved questions of foreign and maritime law.  Also, the Asset Sale was no t a straightforward private sale or public  auction but involved extensive bidding procedures, including the use of a ﬁstalking horseﬂ bidder. c. The Skill Required to Properly Perf orm the Legal Services Rendered:  This  case required the assistance  of attorneys skilled in  bankruptcy as well as  other areas of law.   Biggs and Stubbs adeptly counseled the De btor on bankruptcy and related corporate  matters but quickly utilized other members of  the Firm when faced with issues beyond their  specialty.  The Debtor certainly benefitted from  its retention of a diverse practice firm as  opposed to a solo bankruptcy practitioner, an d the court suspects that employment and use  of special counsel for the tangential matters  would have resulted in  the Debtor incurring  even greater attorneys™ fees than what are reflected in the Application.  d. The Attorney™s Opportunity Costs  in Pressing the In stant Litigation:  There  is no evidence before the court to suggest that the Firm lost other business as a result of its   representation of the Debtor. e. The Customary Fee for Like Work :  The hourly rates charged by members  of the Firm who participated  in this case range from $95.00 to $135.00 for paralegals and  $225.00 to $450.00 for attorneys.  These rates  are customary for Chapter 11 services  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 25 of 31 26  approved by the court in  this district, and the court finds them all to be reasonable, if not  modest, given the complexity of the cas e and the success achieved by the Firm.  f. The Attorney™s Expectations at the Outset of the Litigation :  There is no  evidence before the court to suggest what the  Firm™s expectations might  have been in this  case.  g. The Time Limitations Imposed by the Client or Circumstances :  Bankruptcy  matters, particularly Chapter 11 proceedings , involve more deadlines than general  litigation matters in state or federal courts.   The Firm adhered to timelines within the case  and quickly obtained the necessa ry orders early in the case to allow for the Debtor™s  continued operations.  Karam testified that  the bidding procedures  for the Asset Sale  involved numerous deadlines, and that she  spent considerable tim e working with the  Clerk™s office to make sure that related controversies were timely presented to and heard   by the court so that the Asset Sale  would not be hindered or delayed. h. The Amount of Controversy and the Results Obtained :  The respective  values of the Debtor™s assets and liabilities  at the time of the Petition were substantial,  reflecting a debt to assets ratio of over 1,300 pe rcent.  The court commends the Debtor and  the Firm, in conjunction with assumed effo rts by the Committee and the BA, for quickly  realizing that an orderly sale of its assets was in the best interest of the estate.  Although   this case has essentially become a liquidati ng Chapter 11, the court is convinced that the  Asset Sale combined with the pending resoluti on of other matters will  ultimately result in  a higher distribution to creditors than under a  Chapter 7 liquidation.  Under Chapter 7, it is  unlikely that the majority of assets would be  similarly be sold as a ﬁsingle lotﬂ with  potential purchasers having the op tion to assume liabilities, executory contracts, or leases  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 26 of 31 27  of the Debtor.  Biggs testified that the succe ss of this case would not have been possible  without the approved DIP Financing Transactio n, which enabled the Debtor to continue  operating during the pendency of the Asset Sale , thereby preserving the assets™ value.   Although the Application was filed prior to the approval  of the Asset Sale, many of the  fees associated with obtaining and expediting this approval are reflected in the Application.  i. The Experience, Reputation and Ability of the Attorney :  The Firm is well- recognized as one of the premie re and leading bankruptcy firms  in this district, with its  bankruptcy practice established over forty y ears ago, preceding the creation of bankruptcy  courts by The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978.   As directed by § 330( a)(4)(E), the court notes that both Biggs and Stubbs are certif ied as bankruptcy spec ialists by the North Carolina State Bar Board of Legal Specializati on.  The Firm™s practi ce areas extend beyond bankruptcy and include business law, civil an d criminal litigation,  estate planning and  administration, family law, and real estate law.   This wide range of e xpertise, particularly  in the business law and litigation arenas, proved valuable to the Firm™s representation of  the Debtor.  j. The Undesirability of the Case within the Legal Community in which the  Suit Arose:  There is no evidence befo re the court to suggest that  this case is  considered  undesirable amongst bankruptcy prac titioners in this district. k. The Nature and Length of the Professional Relationship between the  Attorney and Client :  The Firm was retained by the Debtor approximately four months  prior to filing the Petition for the purpose of  structuring a financial rehabilitation and had not previously represented the Debtor in litigation or corporate governance matters.  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 27 of 31 28  l. Attorneys™ Fees Awards in Similar Cases :  The BA compares the Debtor™s  case to a previous Chapter 11  proceeding in this district,  DRI Corporation, Case Number  12-02298-8-SWH.  The  DRI Corporation  case also involved a committee of unsecured  creditors, debtor-in-possession fi nancing, and a § 363 sale that  utilized a ﬁstalking horseﬂ  bidder.  The total fees and costs awarded to  that debtor™s counsel over an approximate two  and one-half year period was $302,547.29,  and that case resulted in  payment in full of all  creditor claims, with some distribution to  equity holders.  The BA suggests that the  Debtor™s case may be administratively insolven t with little or no di stribution to unsecured creditors; therefore, the  total amount of $229, 114.14 requested in th e Application is unreasonable.  The court agrees with Biggs that comparing the  amounts  of attorneys™ fees  and expenses incurred in similar cases is not particularly useful, because each case will   involve different issues and tasks performe d by different professi onals with different  hourly rates.  What is perhaps a more appr opriate comparison is whether the respective  attorneys billed in the same manner, such as th e formula used for billing travel time or what  tasks are assigned to paralegals.  When comparing the Debtor™s case to  DRI Corporation, Biggs pointed out that the overall approach to  representation and billing are similar, and  DRI Corporation™s attorney™s invoices also  reflect instances of re presentation by more than  one attorney at conferences or hearings. 42. The court acknowledges that there is some  duplication of representation among  members of the Firm; however, the court is satis fied with Biggs™ explanations regarding the  frequent need for involvement of  more than one professional.   Section 330(a)(4)(A)(i) prohibits allowance of compensation only for  unnecessary duplication of services , and most duplicative  efforts in this case were probably necessary  for its effective administration and successful  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 28 of 31 29  outcome.  The court agrees with the United Stat es Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of  Tennessee that ﬁ[n]o  per se rule of allowance or disallowance  of fees for intra-office conferences  or multiple appearances at a hearing is required by the Code.  The flexible standard of ‚. . .   reasonable compensation for actual, necessary servi ces . . .™ applies and  case-by-case, if not item- by-item analysis is appropriate.ﬂ  In re Aztec Co. , 113 B.R. 414, 415-416 (Bankr. M.D. Tenn. 1990)  (quoting 11 U.S.C. § 330(a)). 43. The court is also persuaded by case  law recognizing that some Chapter 11  proceedings require the involvement of multiple  attorneys.  For instance, the United States  Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern Di strict of Michigan opined that ﬁthere are times when law firms  can justify billing a debtor for the  services of two or three attorneys at an intra-office conferenceŠ at the beginning of a case to assign work, or at a crit ical juncture in the case to define duties, or to  delegate jobs and then to have pe ople perform those jobs, or to disc uss the status of  various matters  in a large and complicated bankruptcy.ﬂ  In re New Boston Coke Corp. , 299 B.R. 432, 445 (E.D.  Mich. 2003). 44. In In re Kennedy Mfg. , 331 B.R. 744, 750 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio 2005), the United  States Bankruptcy Court for the No rth District of Ohio found th at the United States Trustee™s  concerns of ﬁoverstaffingﬂ were tempered by two  overall considerations:  the complexity of the  case and the successful outcome.  The  Kennedy Mfg. court elaborated: First, and while not needing to delve into all the specifics, the Court is very  cognizant that Counsel for th e Debtors put a lot of work  into this case.  And  although not a prerequisite, the end result in  this case also cannot be ignored:  a  confirmed plan of reorganization was entered by this Court permitting the Debtors   to continue with its operations.  In re Unitcast, Inc. , 214 B.R. 992, 1008-09 (Bankr.  N.D. Ohio 1997) (the results obtained is  a major factor in the  allowance of fees),  aff™d, 219 B.R. 741 (6th Cir. BAP 1998).  The  Court is also aware that this case  involved areas that required the expertis e of nonbankruptcy c ounselŠe.g., issues involving the Debtors™ pens ion planŠand in this way, the law firm of Taft,  Stettinius & Hollister, having attorneys  on its staff with specialized areas of  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 29 of 31 30  expertise, was able to offer such services at reasonable, and potentially lower costs  than had the Debtors been forced to seek such services on a piecemeal basis.    Kennedy Mfg. , 331 B.R. at 750.  Likewise in the case  sub judice, the court is swayed by the results  obtained in this case as a result of the various expertise contributed by the members of the Firm.  45. Staffing a larger and more complex Ch apter 11 case requires almost expert  managerial skills.  Both the case and the personnel assigned to it must be properly managed.  The   luxury of having several attorneys  and staff in a firm representing a debtor is tempered by the duty  to delegate the responsibilities of those persons to  the tasks.  The talents and skill levels of the  professionals and para-professionals must be a llocated to achieve the maximum result at the  minimal cost.  This exercise is more art than scie nce, and care must be give n at every step in the  process to achieve the expected result.  The Fi rm does not stray far from this difficult goal.  46. The court will finally address the BA™s sugge stion that the Fees  are excessive when  compared to the compensation allowed Parker Po e for its representation of the Committee during  the same time period.  Nothing in the Code or the  Johnson Factors requires the court to consider  awards made to other professiona ls within the same case.  The  court can only speculate that the  Committee™s involvement has benefitted the Debt or™s estate; however, the Committee™s assumed  contribution should not affect what would otherwise be allowable compensation under § 330(a).   47. The court thoroughly examined the Invoices  and finds them, particularly the Post- petition Invoices, to be extremely detailed and  telling of exactly what was done and accomplished  in the case.  The court finds all of the Fees  to reflect reasonable compensation for actual and  necessary services of the Firm.   The court understands and appreciates the BA™s concern over the large amount of the Fees; however, in light of th e successful Asset Sale and resolutions of other  matters in the case, the court be lieves that any attempt to redu ce the Firm™s hours under the first  Johnson Factor would be arbitrary at  best.  Even if th e court did choose to reduce the allowable  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 427   Filed 08/11/16   Entered 08/11/16 15:16:47    Page 30 of 31 31  hours, it could also choose to offset this  by an increase of the Firm™s hourly rates.  See Watson  Seafood & Poultry, 40 B.R. at 445 (noting that ﬁ[t]he cour t may adjust the hourly rate to reward  exceptional efforts and benefitsﬂ).  Rather than en gage in a nitpicking effo rt that would not produce  a significantly different end result, the court chooses to allow all of the Fees.  48. The court noted supra that the Pre-petition Expenses  were directly related to the  preparation and filing of the Peti tion, the majority of the Pre-pe tition Expenses being the Chapter  11 filing fee.  As with the Pre-petition Expenses, th e BA likewise did not object to the Post-petition  Expenses.  The court reviewed  all of the Pre-petition Expenses  and Post-petition Expenses  (collectively ﬁExpensesﬂ) and finds them all to  be actual and necessary  expenses incurred in  connection with this case; therefore,  the court allows all of the Expenses. CONCLUSION  49. For the reasons set forth in this Opinion, th e court confirms that  the Application is  granted as provided in the Orde r entered on May 24, 2016.  Pursuant  to §§ 329, 330(a), and 503(b),  the Firm is allowed an administrative e xpense compensation in the amount of $220,655.00 and  reimbursement of expenses in  the amount of $8,459.14 for the  period from November 2, 2015  through March 25, 2016 for a total of $229,114.14, of  which the sum of $10,000.00 has been paid  previously.  In reaching this  conclusion, the court considered  all of the evidence, exhibits,  testimony, and arguments of counsel, regardless of wh ether or not they are specifically mentioned  in this Opinion.

Based upon the evidence presented   and the   arguments of counsel, the court makes the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:   BACKGROUND   1.   The Debtor describes itself as being in the business of designing and manufacturing  luxury performance  cruising catamarans    .     The  Gunboat G4 (  )   is     2.   O n September 24, 2013 , the Debtor and  PeeJeeDee   executed      Design & Copyright Agreement (     . . .   catamaran sailboat . . . for [the Debtor] to   Under the terms of   the G4 Design Agreement, the Debtor and  PeeJeeDee   jointly hold all copyrights associated with the designs created pursuant to the G4 Design  Agreement.    The G4 Design Agreement requires the Debtor to pay to  PeeJeeDee    75,000.00 as a  design fee for the first G4 built from  PeeJeeDee  ,000.00 for each subsequent G4  built.   3.   On October 3,   2013, 1   the Debtor entered into a Licensee Agreement to Manufacture      with Holland, whereby the Debtor granted to Holland a license  and  exclusive right    to manufacture the  G4 .      4.   Section 4.1 of t he Licensing Agreement contemplated that Holland would produce   reimburse Holland a ccording to the following  payment   schedule: 2                                                       1   The date on this Agreement is illegible on the copy of the Agreement presented to the court; however, the  Settlement Agreement, discussed  infra ,  states that the Agreement was dated October 3, 2013.   2   The Holland Co mpanies assert in the Motion to   Reconsid er   that the Debtor has failed to reimburse Holland  as required by the Licensing Agreement and, as a result, has forfeited its ownership interest in   assets it shared jointly  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 444   Filed 09/06/16   Entered 09/06/16 10:59:04    Page 2 of 27 3     4.1.1.1.1   15% of the tooling cost 3   upon commencement of producing the tooling;   4.1.1.1.2   15% of the tooling cost upon completion of the hull, deck and pilothouse  tooling; and   4.1.1.1.3   The remaining 70% of the tooling cost  to be paid in equa l payments upon  delivery of the first ten hulls to the Debtor.     5.   The Licensing Agreement has a n initial   three - year term   through October 2, 2016 .   Section 8.2   of the Li censing Agreement states that   the three - year term shall automatically renew ,   but   either party may give written notice of its intent to terminate the Licensing Agreement   at least  180 days before the three - year term expires  ]   shall      Upon terminati on,  Section 10.6 of the Licensing  Agreement requires  Holland to turn over all tooling to the Debtor, subject to the requirement that  the Debtor pay Holland    Formal Acceptance by the b  4   6.   Two G4 boats have been built to date.  Both took longer to manufacture than the  parties expected.   7.   The Debtor   filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter  11   of the United  States Bankruptcy Code on  November 18, 2015      and began operating as a debtor  in possession pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 1107 .    The Debtor filed its Schedules of assets and liabilities  on  November 30, 2015 .  On Exhibit B to Schedule B    belonging to the Debtor.  The Debtor listed PeeJeeDee as an unsecured creditor with a $14,250.00                                                      with Holland under the Licensing Agreement.  A determination regarding ownership of the assets shared by the Debtor  and Holland pursuant to the Licensing Agreement, while seemingly an essential prerequisite to the sale of the Debt  interest (if any) in those assets, has  not been made by the parties and   is not before the court at this time.   3   The tooling cost was capped at   the lesser of    450,000.00 or the actua l cost of producing the tooling .    4   This modification of the  payment  s chedule contained  in  Section 4.1.1, only applicable in the event Holland  terminates the Licensing Agreement, appears to amend the timing of repayment as originally governed by Section  4.1.1.3.  The court includes this language simply to acknowledge that up  Agreement, the Debtor remains obligated to reimburse Holland for tooling costs.

The Debtor   listed  Holland and   .   8.   Prior to the Petition Date, the Debtor   expressed concern to  the Holland Companies   that the G4    her boat models.  In Januar y   of   2016,  Peter  Johnstone     and  Mr. Van Riemsdijk   began   line , with the Holland Companies taking over all aspects of the design and man ufacture of the G4   and acquiring   all intellectual property rights to the G4 design .      9.   Before Mr. Johnstone and  Mr. Van Riemsdijk   reached any agreement , Mr.  Johnstone was removed from his position as   President of the Debtor and   replaced by Barry Carroll        Mr. Van Riemsdijk  and Mr. Carroll began negotiating a severance of the  relationship between the Debtor and the Holland Companies, and   on January 28, 2016 ,   Mr. Van  Riemsdijk   sent a draft of a settlement agreement to the Debtor.   10.   On January 19,   2016, during the early stages of settlement negotiations between the  Debtor and  Mr. Van Riemsdijk , the Debtor filed an  Amended Expedited Motion for Entry of Order    Assumption and Assignment of Certain Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases Pursuant to §  365; (IV) Approving Payment of Confidential Maximum Stalking Horse Fee;   and (V) Scheduling  of Hearing for Final Approval of Sa  propos ed   a   single lot    or some lesser amount of its assets, and [to] elect to   assume  certain liabilities,  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 444   Filed 09/06/16   Entered 09/06/16 10:59:04    Page 4 of 27 5     executory contracts, or leases of the Debtor     The Holland Companies do not dispute that they  received notice of the Sale Motion.   11.   The Sale Motion   stated   the following:     the Debtor is the holder of various executory contracts, leases, and other intellectual  property rights which it believes are extremely valuable to potential purchasers.   The Debtor believes that establishing a process whereby the known cure amount on  any  contracts and leases is determined in advance of the Bi d Deadline will help the  Debtor   [in evaluating bids].       The Sale Motion proposed that  the Debtor would   do the following:     file and serve on all known counterparties a Schedule of Executory Contracts an d  Unexpired Leases  . . .   that may potentially be assumed and assigned to the ultimate  purchaser of the assets , including the proposed cure amount required pursuant to  section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code for the assumption and assignment of such  contracts, i f any.

Smith    , Managing Director of Finley ,   as     sale of the   Debtor  .    That Application was allowed by Order  entered March 25, 2016.        13.

Neither of the Holland Companies filed a proof of cla im in this case.   16.   On April 1, 2016, Mr. Smith emailed to  Mr. Van Riemsdijk   a proposed settlement   Mr. Van Riemsdijk   to review and sign.  In that same   to provide a six month   [sic]   termination notice [of the Licensing Agreement].  In an abundance of caution, we [the Debtor]  plan to make that notice with the understanding that once the court approves this settlement  agreement the termination notice would b    17.   On April 4, 2016,  Mr. Van Riemsdijk   sent to Mr. Smith a copy of the Settlement  Agreement executed by the Holland Companies.    Under the Settlement Agreement, the Holland  Companies agreed to waive their asserted 5   claim of   515,700.00 against  the Debtor .    Holland  agreed to pay      on the effective date of the Agreement, plus   a royalty fee  of   20,000.0 0   to the Debtor for each G4 sold during the seven years following execution of the  Settlement  Agreement .    The royalty obligation to the Debtor would not be secured by any of  the  Holland   Companie s    assets.   18.   In  his   email   to Mr. Smith   on April 4, 2016 ,   Mr. Van Riemsdijk   stated that he would   obviously with the in tention of it to be void  after court approval of the attached settlement agreement     Mr. Carroll and   Mr. Van Riemsdijk                                                        5    case.   Mr. Van Riemsdi jk   testified that the         Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 444   Filed 09/06/16   Entered 09/06/16 10:59:04    Page 6 of 27 7     19.   Mr. Van Riemsdijk   subsequently emailed Mr. Carroll  o n  April 4, 2016   to state   [d] ue to the 180 day  [sic]  notice period for the licence [sic] agreement we cannot await court  approval of the agreement as discussed with [Mr. Smith].  Please find our termination notice      The attached termination notice    [w] e have reached a  consensus on a settlement agreement, although that agreement does not have court approval as yet.   This termination notice is therefore a caution measure  in the event the settlement agreement should  not be   approved by the court     The  T ermination  N otice also contemplated that  if the Settlement Agreement was not approved by the court   (and the  conditional n otice was  thus  deemed effective to prevent an automatic renewal of the Licensing  Agreement   term ),   then   the  Debtor would owe   5 0 3 , 7 00.00   to Holland, due by October 3, 2016, 6   the expiration date of the  Licensing Agreement   and the effective date of the contemplated termination .   20.   Mr. Smith sent an email   on April 7, 2016   to parties in intere st   of the sale of the   , including Mr.  Van Riemsdijk , notifying them   that the Debtor had extended  the  bid deadline   from April 8, 2016   to April 15, 2016 .    On April 11, 2016, the Debtor filed a Notice  of Designation of Stalking Horse that estab lished a minimum bid to trigger a competitive sale for         21.   On April 13, 2 016, in response to  an inquiry from  Mr. Van Riemsdijk   about the  progress of the Settlement Agreement, counsel for the Debtor sent an email to  Mr. Van Riemsdijk ,  with   he motion [to approve the Settlement Agreement] is being       Counsel  for the Debtor sent a second email to  Mr. Van Riemsdijk   that same day that outlined the procedure                                                      6   This date  is the one  Mr. Van Riemsdijk used in the Termination Notice.      current three year term of the  Licensing Agreement dated October 3, 2013 will expire on October 2, 2016.

Coun sel stated   that a motion seeking     informed  Mr. Van Riemsdijk  that    [i] f no one files a written objection with the Bankruptcy Court during [the required  notice period], the Bankruptcy Cou rt will approve the terms without a hearing.  If  someone does file a written objection,  [the court]   will schedule it for a hearing   . . .  . If there is a hearing, the only likely reason the Bankruptcy Court would not  approve the agreement is if someone else   were willing to pay a hig her price for  whatever interest [the Debtor] may have in [the G4 Design Agreement and  Licensing Agreement] and the [intellectual property related to the  G4 Design  Agreement ].     22.   On April 26, 2016, the court held a hearing on the Sal e Motion   pursuant to the Sale  Procedure Order  majority of that hearing  describing an  auction conducted by the Debtor for the sale of the majority of its assets to the highest bidder,  GL  Yachting USA ,   Inc.        Toward the end of the hearing,     counsel ,   stated that the Debtor had agreed to sell  assets that     Chen   for $108,000.00.    Ms. Biggs   stated   that   the Debtor   ave any other   ose assets .  She  further stated   that    that is part of [ Mr.   ,   and we are working through a couple of issues   Upon inquiry by the court,  Mr. Smith then   voiced   his approval  of Mr. Chen as a purchaser and          23.   At the time of the hearing on the Sale Motion, the court was unaware that the G4  Design Agreement and the Licensing Agreement had not been included on the  Executory Contract  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 444   Filed 09/06/16   Entered 09/06/16 10:59:04    Page 8 of 27 9     Schedule .    Neit her Ms. Biggs nor Mr. Smith mentioned any liabilities owed by the Debtor to the   in the G4 assets.   The court was also unaware of the existence of the Settlement   Agreement and   in the G4  assets pursuant to the Settlement Agreement.   The court  orally  approved the sale of  the G4  assets  to Mr. Chen, pending a final review of the agre ement between the Debtor and Mr. Chen.   24.   On May 4, 2016, Mr. Smith emailed  Mr. Van Riemsdijk to inform him that    prior to the  B id  D  interest in the G4 assets (Intellectual Property, Etc.). The bidder   understands that  Gunboat has a shared interest with [the Holland Companies ].  Because their   [sic]   bid included a   higher cash consideration at closing, the Debtor and the   Unsecured   urt to  approve the Settlement Agreement.     Mr. Smith ackno wledged that this     the US Bankruptcy process requires the Debtor   to  achieve the highest and best offer f or the assets  of the Bankruptcy  Estate     t was determined that th e offer to buy the assets was a  better  recovery for the E state and p rovided more certainty than the  terms of the proposed  [Settlement  Agreement] .     The Holland Companies assert they were unaware that any party had bi d on the      Mr.  Van Riemsdijk    Ms. Biggs after being notified that Mr. Chen had pur chased the assets.   25.   On May 10, 2016 , t he court entered a  Final Order Approving the Sale of Assets  Free and Clear of All Liens, Claims, and Encumbrances to John Chen      as  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 444   Filed 09/06/16   Entered 09/06/16 10:59:04    Page 9 of 27 10     submitted by the Debtor 7   for entry by the court .    The Chen Sale Order    purchase  of  the following:   assets more commonly known as the Gunboat G4 brand including ,  but not limited   branding related to the G4 assets, to include all P roperty defined to be the Tangible  Personal Property and the Intangible Personal Pro perty pursuant to the Agreement ,   .      26.   The referenced Agreement      was attached to the Chen Sale  Order.   The  Chen Sale  Agreement   made no reference to the Licensing Agreement but did   include  the G4 Design Agreement   in its lists of tangible and intangible assets 8   to be sold to Mr. Chen .  It    sell, convey and assign    to    ll of   property  . . .  including:   the designs and intellectual property exclusively related to the Gunboat  [G4]   .        The Chen Sale Agreement also identified the G4 Design Agreement as an executory   [t] h e mechanism for the   assumption or non - assumption of executory contracts  is set forth in more detail in the Sale    that  neither the G4  Design  Agreement  n or the Licensing Agreement    that ma y  potentially be assumed and assigned to the ultimate purchaser of the assets  the Sale Motion.    When the court reviewed the Chen Sale Agreement in conjunction with its entry  of the Chen Sale Order, the court remained unaware that the De btor had never included the  G4  Design Agreement  or  Licensing Agreement   on the Executory Contract Schedule.     The Debtor did  not   otherwise   seek court approval under 11 U.S.C. § 365 to assume or assign the G4 Design  Agreement or Licensing Agreement prior to e xecuting the Chen Sale Agreement.                                                       7       E.D.N.C. LBR 9072 - 1.   8    respectively, to be transferred pursuant to the Chen Sale Agreement.  Both Exhibits A and C stated that the G4 Design  Agreement  was attached as Exhibit A - 2.  There was no Exhibit A - 2 attached to the copy of the Chen Sale Agreement  filed as an exhibit to the Chen Sale Order.   Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 444   Filed 09/06/16   Entered 09/06/16 10:59:04    Page 10 of 27 11     27.   The Chen Sale Order directed   Property   [as defined within the Chen Sale Order]   in its possession or control to [Mr.] Chen ,           28.   The Chen Sale Order    a good faith purchaser   . . .   within  the meaning of Section 363(m)   . . .     waived the stay imposed by Rule 6004(h)   and auth orized  the parties to close   promptly   the sale of assets to Mr. Chen.   Pursuant to the terms of the Chen Sale  Agreement, the sale of assets to Mr. Chen  was scheduled to  close on May 15, 2016 (five days       T he   parties stipulate that the  sale to Mr. Chen  closed  May 18, 2016 when funds were delivered to the Debtor in full ; however,  no physical assets  have changed hands ,   and  the Debtor has not produced a closing statement or bill of sale to the  court .     29.   The   Holland Companies filed the   Motion to Reconsider  on May 23, 2016.    The  M otion to Reconsider seeks relief from the Chen Sale Order under Rules 59(e) and 60(b) of the  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,  made applicable to this proc e ed ing   by Rule s   9023   and 902 4   of  the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure , respectively.    The Motion to Reconsider asserts that  the   court   should  reconsider the sale of assets to Mr. Chen   in light of  evidence that was not made  available to the court at the hearing on the Sale Motion  and to prevent manifest injustice.  The  court did not previously know about the existence of   the Settlement Agreement ,   and   the Holland  Companies  believed   any assets related to the G4 product line would be  excluded from the sale of   .   The Holland Companies argue the Debtor improperly sold the  G4  assets  without giving the Holland Companies   the opportunity to offer a more attractive bid for  those   assets , and for these reasons the Chen Sale Order should be set aside   under Rule 60(b) .    T he  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 444   Filed 09/06/16   Entered 09/06/16 10:59:04    Page 11 of 27 12      would seek  the  court    approval of the Settlement Agreement.   30.   The Motion to Reconsider also questions whether Mr. Chen  constitute s a good faith  purchaser.  The Holland Companies assert that on April 14, 2016, when the Holland Companies  were under the impression that a motion to approve the Settlement Agreement had been filed with  the court, Mr. Johnstone contacted  Mr. Van Riemsdijk   to indicate that  GL Yachting 9   would be   line.  Mr. Johnstone allegedly encouraged  Mr. Van Riemsdijk   to meet Mr. Chen, a  potential   financial partner for the fut ure development of the G4,  so that   Mr. Johnstone  could act as a  salesman for the G4 product line with  Mr. Van Riemsdijk   and   Mr. Chen .  The Holland Parties  question what relationship, if any, Mr. Chen has to Mr. Johnstone, and whether  improper collusion   occ  made in good faith.   31.   Immediately after   filing the Motion to Reconsider, t he Holland Companies  filed a  Notice of Appeal of   the Chen Sale Order on May  23, 2016; 10   however,   the Notice of Appeal will  not become effective until entry of this Order pursuant to Rule 8002(b)(2)   of the Federal Rules of  Bankruptcy Procedure .   32.   In the Response the Debtor and Committee assert that 11 U.S.C. § 363(m)  statutorily moots any attack on the  Chen Sale Order because the Holland Companies failed to  obtain a stay of the Chen Sale Order before the sale to Mr. Chen closed.  The Debtor and                                                      9   According to the Motion to Reconsider, Mr. Johnstone actually stated that Outremer, an affiliate of  GL  Yach ting , would be the highest bidder for      10   The Notice of Appeal filed by the Holland Companies on May 23, 2016 stated that the Holland Companies     G4 product line.  The Holland Companies  filed an Amended Notice of Appeal appealing the Chen Sale Order on May 27, 2016.

At the  h earing on the Motion to Reconsider, Mr. Smith testified regarding the sale  of assets related to the G4 product line.  Mr. Smith stated that   on March 18, 2016, he became aware   interest in the G4 assets.   Mr. Smith also noted that Mr. Johnstone initially expressed interest in  purchasing all or a port  O n March 25, 2016  and  at    Van Riemsdijk   if he would be open to partnering with     to continue production of the G4, and Mr.  Van R iemsdijk   informed Mr. Smith that he was not interested in forming a partnership with anyone unfamiliar to  the Holland Companies.     Mr. Smith never explicitly informed Mr.  Van Riemsdijk   that there was a   terest in the G4 assets   or asked Mr.  Van  Riemsdijk    .     Mr. Smith  stated   at the hearing that he,   Ms. Biggs   and   Mr. Darer   had a conversation about me going to Holland Composites [and asking the Holland Companies  to increase the amount to    that  I had done that  and [the Holland  Companies] had come back and said . . . that they . . . would not be able to increase their bi d.  I did  not reach out to Holland Composites at that bid deadline and ask if [the Holland Companies] would   that b ased on his knowledge of the  negotiations related to the Settlement Agreement,  he   believ ed the Holland Companies would be   Settlement Agreement ; however, Mr. Smith never made that specific inquiry , and that failure is a  monumental mistake.

Ms. Bi ggs stated a t the  h earing   that the purchase funds paid by Mr. Chen had not  yet been disbursed to the Debtor   or its creditors .  No tooling ha s   been transferred from Holland to  Mr. Chen.  Ms. Biggs was unsure whether any intellectual property had been transferred from the  Debtor to Mr. Chen as of the date of the  h earing.   35.   At the hearing,  Mr. Van Riemsdijk   testified about a new boat Holland is curr ently  producing called the F4.  The F4 is six feet longer than the G4 but, like the G4, is also a racing  catamaran.   Mr. Van Riemsdijk   testified that the F4 is built from entirely separate tooling than the  G4 tooling, except that the deck hatch mold from t he G4 is used to build the F4 deck hatch.   Mr.  Van Riemsdijk   predicts that the F4, once available for purchase, will retail at approximately twice  the cost of a G4.    Mr. Darer, c ounsel for the Committee ,   asserted that despite the size and price  difference  between the G4 and F4, the F4 will draw customers away from the G4 ,   and Holland  now appears  less likely to   provide royalties to the Debtor than when the Debtor and Holland  Companies   negotiated the Settlement Agreement .   The Committee offered no creditable  support  for these conclusions.   The Committee argued that forcing the Debtor to seek approval of an  agreement that is allegedly no longer beneficial to the estate is a waste of resources because the  Committee will object to any motion seeking approval of t he Settlement Agreement.   JURISDICTION   1.    the matter underlying the motion.  In re Kim , 384 B.R. 188, 189 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio 2007).   Th e  consideration of a sale of property of the   estate   is a core proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §  157 (b)(2)(N) , and the court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 151, 157, and 1334.     Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 444   Filed 09/06/16   Entered 09/06/16 10:59:04    Page 14 of 27 15     2.   The court has the authority to hear this matter pursuant to the General Order of  Reference entered August 3, 19 84 by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of  North Carolina.   3.    this court of jurisdiction over the Motion to Reconsider, as the Notice of Appeal will not  become  effective until entry of this Order. 11   DISCUSSION     1.   As a threshold issue, the court will first address whether 11 U.S.C. §  363(m)  statutorily moots the Motion to Reconsider   as the Debtor and Committee suggest .   Section 363(m)  states the following:   [t] he reversal or modification  on appeal   of an authorization  . . .   of a sale or lease of  property does not affect the validity of a sale or lease under such authorization to  an entity that purchased or leased such property in good faith, whether or not such  e ntity knew of the pendency of the appeal, unless such authorization and such sale  or lease were stayed pending appeal.     11 U.S.C. § 363(m)   (emphasis added)  s long as the purchase was made in  good faith, the only way to disturb the val idity of the sale is to obtain a stay pending appeal.  Pidcock v. Goddard (In re SII Liquidation Co.) , 2014 Bankr. LEXIS 4436 , at *40   (Bankr. N.D.  Ohio Oct. 17, 2014) .   2.   The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals      has held  in an unpublished  opinion  that § 363(m) is inapplicable when a sale order is attacked collaterally rather than on  appeal.  In re Alan Gable Oil Dev. Co. , 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 29833, at *10 (4th Cir. 1992)                                                      11   See  Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8002(b)(2).  The procedure of this case is distinguishable to that of  In re Winstead ,  33 B.R. 408 (M.D.N.C. 19 83) , in which  after   party moved for a rehearing before the bankruptcy court while the appeal remained pending.  In that case, the United  States District Court for the Middle District of   North Carolina found the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to rehear  the matter.   Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 444   Filed 09/06/16   Entered 09/06/16 10:59:04    Page 15 of 27 16      collaterally by motion under Fed. R. Civ. P.  60(b), section 363(m) on its face does not divest the bankruptcy court of the power to upset the   ;   see also In re Edwards , 962 F.2d 641, 645 (7th Cir. 1992)  (speculating that §   collateral attack on such sales  ;   but see In re Sax  [Section]   363(m) and the cases interpreting  it have clearly held that a stay is necessary to challenge a bankruptcy sale au thorized under §  363(b) [unless the challen ger asserts lack of good faith]  ;  In re Hagood Reserve, LLC , 2010 Bankr.  LEXIS 4486 , at *42   (Bankr. W.D.N.C. Dec. 7, 2010) ( opining    unwind [a] sale untenable    in the absence of a   stay    Rule 60 motion ).     3.     The court  agrees with  and follows  the Fourth Circuit in  In re Alan Gable Oil  Development Company   that § 363(m) does not apply to   the   relief sought  by the Holland Companies  under Rule s 59   and 60   because § 363(m) specifically refers to the appeal of a sale order .     The court   will nevertheless explain why, even if § 363(m) is applicable to   collateral attacks on a sale order,  it   is not applicable  under the circumstances of   this case .      4.   The Hol land Companies did not obtain a stay of the Chen Sale Order , and t he   parties  in this matter stipulate that the   sale of assets to Mr. Chen closed on May 18, 2016, prior to the  Motion to Reconsider and appeal being filed.  At first glance, it may appear that the Holland    ship has sailed     howev er, § 363(m) only protects good faith purchasers from a sale being set aside.     5.     Willemain v. Kivitz , 764 F.2d 1019, 1023 (4th Cir. 1985).  At the  hearing  on the Sale Motion, Mr. Smith and Ms. Biggs did not provide much information about Mr. Chen ,   Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 444   Filed 09/06/16   Entered 09/06/16 10:59:04    Page 16 of 27 17      purchaser.  The court recognizes now that it may have rel ied too heavily on the fact that Mr. Smith,   assets.  Absent any assertions to the contrary at the hearing on the Sale Motion, and upon Ms.      bidder for   the G4 assets, the court found  in the Chen Sale Order that Mr. Chen was a good faith purchaser.     6.    court 12   at the hearing on th e Sale Motion calls into question whether Mr. Chen is a good faith  purchaser.   The Fourth Circuit has recognized three grounds on which a court may grant a motion   (1) to accommodate an intervening  cha nge in controlling law; (2) to account for new evidence not available at trial; or (3) to correct a   Pacific Ins. Co. v. Am. Nat'l Fire Ins. Co. , 148  F.3d 396, 403 (4th Cir. 1998).    7.   With the  newly available   evidence from the Motion to Reconsider in mind, the  court must reassess Mr. Chen against the elements of a good faith purchaser.    a.   Value .    The Holland Companies did not challenge the price Mr. Chen paid   ever, the court is troubled by the fact  that  the  Chen Sale Agreement makes no mention of the Licensing Agreement and does not  address  any cure that might be required under the Licensing Agreement.  The Debtor  apparently treated the Licensing Agreement as terminated upon  receipt of the   T erminat ion  Notice  effective until                                                      12   The court distinguishes the facts before it from situations in which a party that was present at the hearing   s good faith.  See, e.g.  Hazelbaker v. Hope Gas, Inc. (In re  Rare Earth Minerals) , 445 F.3d 359, 365 (4th Cir. 2006) .  In this case, the Holland Companies had no reason to believe  their presence at the hearing on the Sale Motion was necessary.     Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 444   Filed 09/06/16   Entered 09/06/16 10:59:04    Page 17 of 27 18     Oct ober 2, 2016 ,   and the Licensing Agreement remains valid. 13    Holland asserts a claim  against the Debtor under the ter ms of the Licensing Agreement     a   claim which the  Settlement Agreement was meant to resolve.  The court was not  made  aware of the terms  of th e Licensing Agreement when the proposed sale to Mr. Chen was presented to the court.   Upon examination of the Licensing Agreement and its terms, and in light of the fact   that   the Chen Sale Agreement fails to account for the   Licensing   Agreement in any manne r  whatsoever, the court is   now   unsure of the  actual     price   to the  estate .    A t  the  hearing on  the  Motion to Reconsider, Mr. Smith compared the  unsecured   00.00 bid   and asserted   Mr. Chen offered the highest  and most certain  value to the estate .   Those  terms, however, do not appear comparable .    Mr. Chen   presumably did not    interest in the G4 assets (whatever interest that may be) subject to H  , because  the sale  was to be   free and clear of liens ,   and Mr. Chen did not assume the Licensing  Agreement .    If Mr. Chen did not take the assets subject to  any cure amount , does the Debtor  remain responsible under the Licensing Agreement   for any monies owed to Holland ? 14                                                        13   At the hea ring, the court brought up the question of whether a party could unilaterally terminate a contract  with a debtor without violating the automatic stay of 11 U.S.C. § 362.  That question is not before the court, and may  not be relevant because the terminatio n is not yet effective.  Even if the Termination Notice triggered immediate  termination of the Licensing Agreement, the court finds it was ineffective because it named a condition precedent (the  Settlement Agreement being presented to the court and the cou rt disapproving it) that never occurred.  The Committee  raised the question at the hearing whether Holland has breached the Licensing Agreement by using deck hatch molds  for the G4 to produce the F4 deck hatches.  Section 6.6 of the Licensing Agreement pro hibits Holland from using the  G4 tooling to produce boats or parts other than those used to build the G4.  The provisions of Section 9 govern early  termination of the Licensing Agreement in the event of default.  It appears from the terms of the Licensing  Agreement  that breach (by using tooling to produce F4 parts) would give the Debtor the right to terminate the Licensing  Agreement if the breach is not rectified within 30 days of receiving written notice thereof.  As a breach of the Licensing  Agreement doe s not result in automatic termination, and no evidence having been presented that the Debtor gave  written notice to Holland of the alleged breach, the Licensing Agreement appears to remain in effect.   14   The Debtor has apparently not rejected the Licensing A greement, so the provisions of § 502(g) do not  appear applicable to determine what amount might be owed to Holland.  In the Response, the Debtor and Committee      the Settlement Agreement was the cash that the Holland Companies would pay.  It seems the Debtor believes that  because it  technically  has not rejected the Licensing Agreement, any claim asserted by Holland is either barred by the  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 444   Filed 09/06/16   Entered 09/06/16 10:59:04    Page 18 of 27 19     The court    to  ascertain the overall value       purchase price is  sufficient   purchased the assets for value under § 363 (m).   b.   Good Faith and  Without Notice of Adverse Claims .    The   court will address  these two elements together.  The   court has  no concrete evidence that Mr. Chen was aware  of the existence of the Settlement Agreement when he executed the Chen Sale Agreement;   the   phone call from Mr. Johnstone   n partnering with   Mr. Chen causes the court to  wonder whether Mr. Chen had knowledge of  the Holland Companie s    assertion of rights  over the G4 assets.    The apparent connection between Mr. Chen and Mr. Johnstone, who  participated in initial settlement negot iations with  the  Holland   Companies , could  conceivably have fostered collusion between Mr. Chen and Mr. Johnstone in  exploring  the  purchase of the G4 assets.  This type of involvement  may   affect a finding of good faith.  See , e.g.   Willemain , 764 F.2d   at 1023 (quoting  In re Rock Industries Machinery Corp. , 572  F.2d 1195, 1198 (7th Cir. 1978)   misconduct that would destroy a  purchaser  s good faith status at a judicial sale involves fraud,  collusion between the  purchaser and other bidders   or the trustee , or an attempt to take grossly unfair advantage  of other bidders.  ) (emphasis added ).    I f Mr. Chen had knowledge of the Settlement  Agreement when he placed his bid,     interest s   in the assets subject  to the   G4 Design Ag reement and   Licensing Agreement could be construed as adverse  claim s   to those assets.   The court recognizes that its theories of Mr. Chen  speculative.    Mr. Chen may or may not have acted in bad faith when he bid on the Debto                                                      clai ms deadline or somehow extinguished through the sale to Mr. Chen.  This outcome would be nonsensical and  apparently relies on the incorrect assumption that the Licensing Agreement has been terminated by Holland.   Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 444   Filed 09/06/16   Entered 09/06/16 10:59:04    Page 19 of 27 20     interest in  the G4 assets; however, the  Holland Companies have presented sufficient  evidence to warrant the court  amending, pursuant to Rule 59(e),   its finding that Mr. Chen  was a good faith purchaser for value and without notice of adverse claims.      8.   I n light of the e vidence presented by the Holland Companies at the hearing on the  Motion to Reconsider , and upon reconsideration of the proposed sale to Mr. Chen , the court hereby  retracts its finding  in the Chen Sale Order  that Mr. Chen is a good faith purchaser.    As § 363(m)  only protects good faith purchasers from reversal of a sale order, it does not protect Mr. Chen   in  this case , and  the Chen Sale Order can be set aside   without running afoul of § 363(m) , 15   so long  as the Holland Companies establish that relief  is warranted under Rule 60(b) .  See   Wortley v.  Chrispus Venture Capital, LLC (In re Global Energies, LLC) , 763 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.  2014) ( c  of good faith and vo id the sale ) .   9.   Rule 60(b) states   as follows :   On motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its legal representative  from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:   (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect ;   (2) newly discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, could not have  been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b);   (3) fraud (whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation,  or misconduct by an opposing  party;   (4) the judgment is void;   (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged; it is based on an  earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying it prospectively is  no longer equitable; or   (6) any other reason that justifies   relief.                                                         15   As already noted, the court does not belie ve § 363(m) applies to collateral attacks on a sale order, but even  if § 363(m) does apply to a Rule 60(b) motion, the court finds it is inapplicable in this case.  Some courts have also   § 363(m) mootness is not applicable when  [a party]   seeks t o attack the § 363 sale of estate property on   the   § 363(m) requires that the sale be authorized     [and   §  363] (b) specifically requires a      In re Moberg Trucking, Inc. , 112 B.R.   362, 363 (B.A.P. 9th Cir.   1990)   (quoting 11 U.S.C. § 363(b), (m)).  As discussed  infra , the Holland Companies were not given adequate notice  of the fact that the G4 related assets would be sold; however, the court declines to find that § 363(m) is inapplic able  based on improper notice, relying instead on its legal conclusions discussed  supra .   Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 444   Filed 09/06/16   Entered 09/06/16 10:59:04    Page 20 of 27 21     Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).  If a party is able to show cause under Rule 60(b), a court may set aside an     10.    A bankruptcy court may vacate a prior order confirming a sale, however, only in  very limited circum stances in the exercise of its powers as a court of equity.    In re Chung King,  Inc. , 753 F.2d 547, 549 (7th Cir.  1985) (citing   In re Beck Industries, Inc. , 605 F.2d 624, 634 (2d  Cir. 1979);  Mason v. Ashback , 383 F.2d 779, 780 (10th Cir. 1967) ).    The limite d circumstances  under which courts have set aside sale orders typically involve transactions    tinged with fraud,  error or similar defects which would in equity affect the valid    In re  General Insecticide   Co. , 403 F.2d at 631  (quoting 4A  Collier on Bankruptcy , P70.98[16] (14th ed.  1967)).     equities outweigh the interests in finality .  In re CADA Invest.,  Inc. , 664   F.2d 1158, 1162 (9th Cir.  1981) .   11.    In order to obtain relief from a judgment under Rule  60(b), a moving party must  show that his motion is timely, that he has a meritorious defense to the action, and that the opposing  party would not be unfairly prejudiced by       Admin. Bd. v. Gray , 1 F.3d 262, 2 64 (4th Cir. 1993)  (quoting  Park Corp. v. Lexington Ins. Co. ,  812 F.2d 894, 896 (4th Cir. 1987) ) .    If a party can pass this threshold requirement, it then must  satisfy one of the six grounds for relief contained in Rule 60(b).  Id.  at 266.   a.   The Motion to Rec onsider Is Timely   Motion to Reconsider was filed   less than  two weeks after the court enter ed the Chen Sale  Order.  The Debtor in sists the Holland Companies would have needed to file the Motion  to Reconsider before the sale to Mr. Chen closed in order to warrant relief.  At the hearing,  the Debtor focused on the fact that  Mr. Van Riemsdijk    Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 444   Filed 09/06/16   Entered 09/06/16 10:59:04    Page 21 of 27 22     4, 2016 em ail notifying the Holland Companies of the sale to  Mr.  Chen, implying  Mr. Van  Riemsdijk  the sale through the Motion to Reconsider.   Mr. Van Riemsdijk   testified that he was so  sh  That reaction is reasonable given the prior representations and assurances by Mr. Smith  and Ms. Biggs.  The Holland Companies  engaged   counsel and filed the Motion to  Reconsider within 19  days of receiving the email from   Mr. Smith.  The court finds that the  Motion to Reconsider was filed within a reasonable amount of time.     b.   The Holland Companies Have  a  M eritorious  D efense to the  A ction .    As  discussed  supra , the Holland Companies  have successfully questioned   the good   faith of  Mr. Chen .   The Holland Companies could further argue that § 363(e) provides them with  the right to challenge the sale of the G4 assets to a third party, or at a mini mum, request  judicial determination of the rights of the Debtor and the Holland Companies under the G4  Design Agreement and the Licensing Agreement before any G4 assets are sold to a third  party.  Similarly, the Holland Companies may have a meritorious arg ument that as long as  the G4 Design Agreement and Licensing Agreement remain valid, certain intellectual  property and possibly the tooling remain co - owned assets and any sale of the G4 assets  would require a sale pursuant to § 363(h).    S ufficient potential   defenses to the sale of the  G4 assets  exist  to satisfy this  prerequisite   for the court to entertain a motion under Rule  60(b).   c.   Mr. Chen Will Not Be Unfairly Prejudiced if the Chen Sale Order is Set  Aside .  The court recognizes that the   parties stipulate that the   sale to Mr. Chen  has closed,  but that stipulation is inconclusive.    T  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 444   Filed 09/06/16   Entered 09/06/16 10:59:04    Page 22 of 27 23     trust account ,   and no  physical   assets have traded hands pursuant to the Chen Sale  Agreement .    The court has se en no closing statement or bill of sale.    The sale has not been  consummated, and while Mr. Chen  may be displeased with these events,  he will not be  unfairly prejudiced.   In the words of  Mr. Bircher,   ,   this  is not an egg that  cannot be unscrambled.       12.   The   Holland Companies have satisfied the threshold requirements of a Rule 60(b)  motion.   Turning to the grounds for relief from an order enumerated in Rule 60(b), the court finds  that the   Chen Sale Order should be set aside   in ligh t of the evidence the Holland Companies  presented to the court.    Specifically, the notice  regarding the sale of the G4 assets  provided to the  Holland Companies was inadequate under the circumstances   and constitutes surprise under Rule  60(b)(1) .    The assura nce by Ms. Biggs that a motion for approval of the Settlement Agreement  would be filed , while probably inadvertent,   was a misrepresentation under Rule 60(b)(3).     The sale  should also be set aside on the grounds that the Chen Sale Agreement and Chen Sale Or der failed  to resolve  clearly   Agreement and the Licensing Agreement.   13.   Inadequate Notice of the Sale   and Misrepresentation of the Settlement Agreement .   a.    Due process requires  notice that is reasonably calculated, under the  circumstances, to apprise an interested party of the pendency of an action.    WBQ Ptnr. v.  Virginia Dep't of Medical Assistance Servs. (In re WBQ Ptnr.) , 189 B.R. 97, 103 (Bankr.  E.D. Va. 1995) (quoting  Snug E nter., Inc. v. Sage (In re Snug Enter., Inc.) ,   169 Bankr. 31,  33 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1994) (citing  Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co. ,   339 U.S.  306, 314 - 15 (1950)).   Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 444   Filed 09/06/16   Entered 09/06/16 10:59:04    Page 23 of 27 24     b.   Although the Holland Companies received notice of the Sale Motion and  the Sale Proced ure Order, they were led to believe that the G4 assets would not be sold  pursuant to the Sale Procedure Order.   Ms. Biggs   explicitly told Mr. Van Riemsdijk that  the Debtor would be seeking court approva l of the Settlement Agreement.  She led Mr.  Van Riemsd ijk to believe that the only way the G4 assets would be subject to a third party  bid was in the event the motion to approve the Settlement Agreement prompted a bid for   agreeme  no reason to think the assets subject to the  G4 Design Agreement and  Licensing Agreement  might be sold pursuant to the Sale Procedure Order.   c.   The   notice   and reliance   circumst ances of this case are similar to those  described in  In re Winstead , 33 B.R. 408   (M.D.N.C. 1983).  In that case,  the trustee filed  an application for court approval of   the sale of   estate property to Mr. Felts for $44,000.00,  but at the hearing on the appli cation sought approval to sell to Mr. Bishop for $45,000.00.   Id.  at 409.    Mr. Felts received notice of the application but did not attend the hearing, and  at the hearing the court approved the sale to Mr. Bishop.   Id.    The United States District  Court for the Middle District of North Carolina found that, under the circumstances, notice  of the  sale   was inadequate because it   the property   to Mr. Felts for $44,000 wou    Id.  at 410.  Mr.  Felts in  Winstead   relied on notice that the proposed sale  was   to him and did not  believe his  presence at the   sale hearing   was necessary.  Similarly , Mr.   Van Riemsdijk and the Holland  Compan ies relied on Ms  Agreement would be filed and did not  believe they needed to participate in any bidding  Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 444   Filed 09/06/16   Entered 09/06/16 10:59:04    Page 24 of 27 25     pursuant to the Sale Procedure Order.    interest in the G4 asset s, the Holland Companies were not given notice of that bid or the   This failure lies squarely with Finley .   The Holland  Companies were not given adequate notice that approval of the sale of   the    in the   G4 assets would be sought at the hearing on April 26, 2016.      d.   Further, the Executory Contract Schedule did not list the G4 Design  Agreement or the Licensing Agreement as executory contracts that may potentially be   ets.  The Chen Sale Agreement   lists the G4  Design Agreement as an executory contract being assumed by Mr. Chen.  Pee J ee D ee did   Design Agreement.      14.   Uncertainty of Asse ts  Sold .   Also weighing in favor of setting aside the Chen Sale  Order is that the court is not even  sure  what Mr. Chen purchased pursuant to the Chen Sale  Agreement .  The court  questions whether 11 U.S.C. § 365  may  requir e   additional  court  consideration of   the transaction   and its effect on the G4 Design Agreement and Licensing  Agreement .  As noted  sup ra , the Chen Sale Agreement makes  no reference to the Licensing  Agreement ,   and no notice of the  potential  assumption of the G 4 Design Agreement was given   in  th e Executory Contract Schedule filed with the court .   Mr. Chen purchased, in the words of Mr.   rights are shared with the [Holland Companies] so Mr. Chen recog     Despite this   representation , the Chen Sale  Agreement makes no mention of the Licensing Agreement.     Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 444   Filed 09/06/16   Entered 09/06/16 10:59:04    Page 25 of 27 26     15.   A dequate notice  was not afforded  to   the   Holland parties .     T he assets   sub ject to sale   were not clearly identified and executory contracts were not correctly assumed and assigned ,  and  the  sale process was compromised.   The Sale Procedure Order and the employment of Mr. Smith  and Finley  should have   ensure d   fairness, order and tra  but that result was not achieved.    Instead, Mr. Smith and Ms. Biggs, as officers of the court, misled  ( hopefully  unintentionally) the Holland Companies regarding the potential fate of the G4 assets.   The   bidder for the assets was misleading   to the court .  The Chen Sale Order must be set aside .      16.    ortant as   In re W.A. Mallory Co. , 214 B.R. 834, 838 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1997).  If the court were  to allow the Chen Sale Order to stand, the court would be fostering the perception that  an  unsuspecting party may  forfeit   its rights at the proverb ial  eleventh - hour  if a debtor finds a more  attractive suitor.  The court is aware of the counter - argument Mr. Chen would surely raise in   court is sympathetic   ,   but   the failure of the Debtor and Finley  to ensure  transparency and fairness in the sale of the G4 assets   demands revocation of   the Chen Sale Order .      17.   The  revocation of the Chen Sale  Order  is necessary even if the Holland Compani es  are unable   subsequently to   ,   and the  Debtor again  proposes  Mr. Chen as purchaser.  Any subsequent sale of the assets must comply  with § 365 and must clearly identify what interests the Debtor hol ds.  If Mr. Chen is ultimately the  highest bidder for those interests, he will benefit in the end from actually knowing what he bought ,  and the court will fulfill its responsibilities for properly  evaluating and sanctioning that sale .   Case 15-06271-5-DMW    Doc 444   Filed 09/06/16   Entered 09/06/16 10:59:04    Page 26 of 27 27     18.   Regarding the Holland    performance in the form of a motion to approve the Settlement Agreement, the court finds that  relief is neither reasonable nor feasible.  As counsel for the Committee noted at the hearing, if the  Debtor w ere forced to file the Settlement Agreement for court approval, the Committee would  object on the grounds that the terms of the Settlement Agreement are even less favorable now than  they were in April, now that the Debtor is aware that Holland is developin g the F4.    The court is  still not convinced the G4 and the F4 are  even  remotely similar , except for a similar deck hatch,   .    The Chen Sale Order shall be set aside, and the  Debtor   and  Finley,  its   broker/sale   facilitator    remain   responsible for determining what assets are  available for sale and how best to sell them ; now therefore,     It is ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED  that the Chen Sale Order be, and hereby is  set aside .
