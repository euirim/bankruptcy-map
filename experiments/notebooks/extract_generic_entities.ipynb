This information may become available to the general public.  Attorneys” Fees LAF will not charge me for its work  in some cases, LAF may be able to claim attorneys' fees from the opposing party. I authorize LAF to seek, collect and keep attorneys’ fees whenever it is permitted by law to do so, whether by obtaining a court order awarding fees, or through a settlement agreement with the opposing  party. Court—Related Costs  In the course of representing me, LAF may have to pay court costs on my behalf. These may include official fees for filing, recording documents, obtaining subpoenas for witnesses, and service of papers, as well as out-of—pocket costs for printing, copying, court reporters, transcripts, expert witnesses, and other such expenses. I understand and agree that I may have to repay such costs. LAF will try to get these costs waived whenever possible, and will do its best to inform me of the costs before they are incurred.  LAF may seek to recover such costs from the opposing party at the end of the case If the court orders the other side to pay costs incurred by LAF, then I agree that the costs should be paid directly to LAF and not to me. if I am awarded a money judgment that does not specifically provide for the payment of costs, then i agree to repay LAF the costs it incurred, out of the money i receive. If I do not recover any money in my case, i am still responsible to reimburse LAF for the costs it incurred on my behalf, unless I cannot afford to do so  Settlement  LAF will not settle any part of my case without my approval LAF will inform me of any offers from the opposing party to settle the case. i agree not to settle my case without telling LAF first and providing LAF with the opportunity to discuss the proposed settlement with me.  Some opposing parties may offer a settlement that requires LAF to give up its right to attorneys' fees and costs LAF depends on attorneys' fee awards to help continue its work. Settlements that require LAF to give up its right to fees and costs make it more difficult for LAF to provide legal  reasons, LHI\" Blluuurdgcb UIIUIILD LU urrrrn balcrurly before accepting such an offer.  Complaint procedures  Anyone who has a complaint about the way service was provided (or not provided), is entitled to have that complaint reviewed in accordance with the following rules:  When a complaint is made, a supervisory attorney will review it and try to solve the problem.

In the event that the Executive Director is unable to resolve a complaint, the Executive Director will notify the person that he or she may have the complaint reviewed by a committee or sub-committee of the Board of Directors of LAF.  All complaints will be reviewed within a reasonable period of time after they are made, but no longer than 60 days.  Ending this agreement  This is an agreement for a case, task or matter. When the case is over or the task is completed or the matter is resolved, this agreement ends. Ifl have a different legal problem or if an appeal is necessary, a new application for services is needed.

I am no longer financially eligible under LAF's guidelines.  . I do not obey a court order which LAF advises me to obey.  . LAF determines that it would be ethically wrong to continue to represent me.  - Further work on the case would be only for the purpose of harassing or harming another person.  . lfthere are other reasons why LAF cannot continue to represent me, LAF will tell me what those reasons are.  After LAF starts to represent me in a case before a court or agency, it can withdraw from the UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS  NOTICE TO CONSUMER DEBTOR(S) UNDER § 342(b) OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE  In accordance with § 342(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, this notice to individuals with primarily consumer debts: (1) Describes brieﬂy the services available from credit counseling services; (2) Describes brieﬂy the purposes, benefits and costs of the four types of bankruptcy proceedings you may commence; and (3) Informs you about bankruptcy crimes and notifies you that the Attorney General may examine all information you supply in connection with a bankruptcy case.  You are cautioned that bankruptcy law is complicated and not easily described. Thus, you may wish to seek the advice of an attorney to learn of your rights and responsibilities should you decide to file a petition. Court employees cannot give you legal advice.  Notices from the bankruptcy court are sent to the mailing address you list on your bankruptcy petition. In order to ensure that you receive information about events concerning your case, Bankruptcy Rule 4002 requires that you notify the court of any changes in your address. If you are ﬁling a joint case (a single bankruptcy case for two individuals married to each other), and each spouse lists the same mailing address on the bankruptcy petition, you and your spouse will generally receive a single copy of each notice mailed from the bankruptcy court in a jointly-addressed envelope, unless you file a statement with the court requesting that each spouse receive a separate copy of all notices.  1. Services Available from Credit Counseling Agencies  With limited exceptions, § 109(h) 0f the Bankruptcy Code requires that all individual debtors who file for bankruptcy relief on or after October 17, 2005, receive a briefing that outlines the available opportunities for credit counseling and provides assistance in performing a budget analysis. The briefing must be given within 180 days before the bankruptcy filing. The briefing may be provided individually or in a group (including briefings conducted by telephone or on the Internet) and must be provided by a nonprofit budget and credit counseling agency approved by the United States trustee or bankruptcy administrator. The clerk of the bankruptcy court has a list that you may consult of the approved budget and credit counseling agencies. Each debtor in a joint case must complete the briefing.     In addition, after filing a bankruptcy case, an individual debtor generally must complete a financial management instructional course before he or she can receive a discharge. The clerk also has a list of approved financial management instructional courses. Each debtor in a joint case must complete the course.  2. The Four Chapters of the Bankruptcy Code Available to Individual Consumer Debtors  Chapter 7: Liquidation ($245 ﬁling fee, $46 administrative fee, $15 trustee surcharge: Total Fee $306)  Chapter 7 is designed for debtors in financial difficulty who do not have the ability to pay their existing debts. Debtors whose debts are primarily consumer debts are subject to a \"means test\" designed to determine whether the case should be permitted to proceed under chapter 7. If your income is greater than the median income for your state of residence and family size, in some cases, the United States trustee (or bankruptcy administrator), the trustee, or creditors have the right to file a motion requesting that the court dismiss your case under § 707(b) of the Code. It is up to the court to decide whether the case should be dismissed.  Under chapter 7, you may claim certain of your property as exempt under governing law. A trustee may have the right to take possession of and sell the remaining property that is not exempt and use the sale proceeds to pay your creditors.  The purpose of filing a chapter 7 case is to obtain a discharge of your existing debts. If, however, you are found to have committed certain kinds of improper conduct described in the Bankruptcy Code, the court may deny your discharge and, if it does, the purpose for which you filed the bankruptcy petition will be defeated.  Even if you receive a general discharge, some particular debts are not discharged under the law. Therefore, you may still be responsible for most taxes and student loans; debts incurred to pay nondischargeable taxes; domestic support and property settlement obligations; most fines, penalties, forfeitures, and criminal restitution obligations; certain debts which are not properly listed in your bankruptcy papers; and debts for death or personal injury caused by operating a motor vehicle, vessel, or aircraft while intoxicated from alcohol or drugs. Also, if a creditor can prove that a debt arose from fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, or theft, or from a willful and malicious injury, the bankruptcy court may determine that the debt is not discharged.  Chapter 13: Repayment of All or Part of the Debts of an Individual with Regular Income ($235 ﬁling fee,  (ID/IL nJm:n:n‘-nn4:vvn fan. VFAA-nl L'nn ¢GO1\\ O  a period of time. You are only eligible for chapter 13 if your debts do not exceed certain dollar amounts set forth in the Bankruptcy Code.  Under chapter 13, you must file with the court a plan to repay your creditors all or part of the money that you owe them, using your future earnings. The period allowed by the court to repay your debts may be three years or ﬁve years, depending upon your income and other factors. The court must approve your plan before it can take effect.  After completing the payments under your plan, your debts are generally discharged except for domestic support obligations; most student loans; certain taxes; most criminal fines and restitution obligations; certain debts which are not properly listed in your bankruptcy papers; certain debts for acts that caused death or personal injury; and certain long term secured obligations.  Chapter 11: Reorganization ($1,167 filing fee, $46 administrative fee: Total fee $1,213)  Chapter 11 is designed for the reorganization of a business but is also available to consumer debtors. Its provisions are quite complicated, and any decision by an individual to file a chapter 11 petition should be reviewed with an attorney.  Chapter 12: Family Farmer or Fisherman ($200 filing fee, $46 administrative fee: Total fee $246)  Chapter 12 is designed to permit family farmers and fishermen to repay their debts over a period of time from future earnings and is similar to chapter 13. The eligibility requirements are restrictive, limiting its use to those whose income arises primarily from a family-owned farm or commercial fishing operation.  3. Bankruptcy Crimes and Availability of Bankruptcy Papers to Law Enforcement Ofﬁcials  A person who knowingly and fraudulently conceals assets or makes a false oath or statement under penalty of perjury, either orally or in writing, in connection with a bankruptcy case is subject to a fine, imprisonment, or both. All information supplied by a debtor in connection with a bankruptcy case is subject to examination by the Attorney General acting through the Ofﬁce of the United States Trustee, the Ofﬁce of the United States Attorney, and other components and employees of the Department of Justice.  WARNING: Section 521(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code requires that you promptly file detailed information regarding your creditors, assets, liabilities, income, expenses and general financial condition. Your bankruptcy case may be dismissed if this information is not filed with the court within the time deadlines set by the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules, and the local rules of the court. The documents and the deadlines for filing them are listed on Form B200, which is posted at  http ://www.uscourts. gov/bkforms/bankruptcy_forms.html#procedure.

If you cannot do so, you are not eligible to file a bankruptcy case, and the court can dismiss any case you do file. If that happens, you will lose whatever filing fee you paid, and your creditors will be able to resume collection activities against you. If your case is dismissed and you file another bankruptcy case later, you may be required to pay a second filing fee and you may have to take extra steps to stop creditors' collection activities.  Every individual debtor must file this Exhibit D. If a joint petition is filed, each spouse must complete and file a separate Exhibit D. Check one of the five statements below and attach any documents as directed.  I 1. Within the 180 days before the filing of my bankruptcy case, I received a briefing from a credit counseling agency approved by the United States trustee or bankruptcy administrator that outlined the opportunities for available credit counseling and assisted me in performing a related budget analysis, and I have a certificate from the agency describing the services provided to me. Attach a copy of the certificate and a copy of any debt repayment plan developed through the agency.  III 2. Within the 180 days before the filing of my bankruptcy case, I received a briefing from a credit counseling agency approved by the United States trustee or bankruptcy administrator that outlined the opportunities for available credit counseling and assisted me in performing a related budget analysis, but I do not have a certificate from the agency describing the services provided to me. You must file a copy of a certificate from the agency describing the services provided to you and a copy of any debt repayment plan developed through the agency no later than 14 days after your bankruptcy case is filed.  III 3. I certify that I requested credit counseling services from an approved agency but was unable to obtain the services during the seven days from the time I made my request, and the following exigent circumstances merit a temporary waiver of the credit counseling requirement so I can file my bankruptcy case now. [Summarize exigent circumstances here. ] _  If your certification is satisfactory to the court, you must still obtain the credit counseling briefing within the first 30 days after you file your bankruptcy petition and promptly file a certificate from the agency that provided the counseling, together with a copy of any debt management plan developed through the agency. Failure to fulfill these requirements may result in dismissal of your case. Any extension of the 30-day deadline can be granted only for cause and is limited to a maximum of 15 days. Your case may also be dismissed if the court is not satisfied with your reasons for ﬁling your bankruptcy case without first receiving a credit counseling briefing.  III 4.

Any attorney retained to represent a debtor in a Chapter 13 case is responsible for representing the debtor on all matters arising in the case unless otherwise ordered by the court. For all of the services outlined above, the attorney will be paid a fee of 3 4,000.00 .  Prior to signing this agreement the attorney has received 33 500.00 , leaving a balance due of S 3,500.00 . In extraordinary circumstances, such as extended evidentiary hearings or appeals, the attorney may apply to the court for additional compensation for these services. Any such application must be accompanied by an itemization of the services rendered, showing the date, the time expended, and the identity of the attorney performing the services. The debtor must be served. with a copy of the application and notified of the right to appear in court to object.  2. Early tart-nitration of the case. Fees payable under the provisions set out above are not refundable in the event that the case is dismissed, unless the dismissal is due to a failure by the attorney to comply with the duties set out in this agreement. If a dismissal is due to such a failure by the attorney, the court may order a refund. of fees on motion by the debtor.  3. Retainers. The attorney may receive a retainer or other payment before filing the case, but. may not receive fees directly from the debtor after the filing of the case. Unless the following provision is checked and completed, any retainer by the attorney will be treated as a security retainer, to be placed in the attorney's client trust account until approval of a fee application by the court.  3 Any retainer received by the attorney will be treated as an advance payment, aliowing the  attorney to take the retainer into income immediately. The reason for this treatment is the following:  Client understands that an funds that client is tenderin to Robert J. Semrad & Associates, LLC as part of this advance payment retainer shall immediately become the property of Robert J. Semrad 8: Associates, LLC in exchange for a commitment by Robert J. Semrad & Associates, LLC to provide the legal services described above. Said funds will be deposited into the main bank account owned by Robert J. Semrad & Associates, LLC and will be used for general expenses of the firm. Client further understands that it is ordinarily the client‘s option to deposit funds with an attorney that shall remain client's property as  security for future services. However, Robert J. Semrad & Associates, LLC does not represent clients under  such a security retainer because the preparation of a bankruptcy case regulres many disparate tasks and functions for the attorney and support staff; some of which reguire toga! expertise while others may be only ministerial in nature. Client further understands that the benefit that client is receiving under this fee arrangement is the commitment of Robert J. Semrad 8: Associates, LLC to perform any and all work  reasonably necessagy to represent client‘s interests absent any extraordinagy circumstances.  In any application for fees, whether or not requiring an itemization, the attorney shall disclose to the court any fees paid by the debtor prior to the case filing.  4. Improper conduct by the attorney. If the debtor disputes the sufficiency or quality of the legal services provided or the amount of the fees charged by the attorney, the debtor may file an objection with the court and request a hearing.  5. Improper conduct by the debtor. If the attorney believes that the debtor is not complying with the debtor’s responsibilities under this agreement. or is otherwise not engaging in preper conduct, the attorney may apply for a court. order allowing the attorney to withdraw from. the case.  6. Discharge of the attorney. The debtor may discharge the attorney at any time.

Timely respond to the Chapter 13 trustee’s motions to dismiss the case, such as for  payment default, or unfeasibility, and to motions to increase the percentage payment to unsecured creditors.  14. Timely respond to motions for relief from stay. 15. Prepare, file, and serve all appropriate motions to avoid liens. 16. Provide any other legal services necessary for the administration of the case.  ALLOWANCE AND PAYMENT OF ATTORNEYS ' FEES  1. Any attorney retained to represent a debtor in a Chapter 13 case is responsible for representing  the debtor on all matters arising in the case unless otherwise ordered by the court. For all of the services outlined above, the attorney will be paid a fee of 33w Prior to signing this agreement the attorney has received $ 500.00 , leaving a balance due of $ 3,500.00 . In extraordinary circumstances, such as extended evidentiary hearings or appeals, the attorney may apply to the court for additional compensation for these services. Any such application must be accompanied by an itemization of the services rendered, showing the date, the time expended, and the identity of the attorney performing the services. The debtor must be served with a copy of the application and notified of the right to appear in court to object.  2. Early termination of the case. Fees payable under the provisions set out above are not refundable in the event that the case is dismissed, unless the dismissal is due to a failure by the attorney to comply with the duties set out in this agreement. If a dismissal is due to such a failure by the attorney, the court may order a refund of fees on motion by the debtor.  3. Retainers. The attorney may receive a retainer or other payment before filing the case, but may not receive fees directly from the debtor after the filing of the case. Unless the following provision is checked and completed, any retainer by the attorney will be treated as a security retainer, to be placed in the attorney's client trust account until approval of a fee application by the court.  I Any retainer received by the attorney will be treated as an advance payment, allowing the attorney to take the retainer into income immediately. The reason for this treatment is the following:  Client understands that any funds that client is tendering to Robert J. Semrad & Associates, LLC as part of this advance payment retainer shall immediately become the property of Robert J. Semrad & Associates, LLC in exchange for a commitment by Robert J. Semrad & Associates, LLC to provide the legal services described above. Said funds will be deposited into the main bank account owned by Robert J. Semrad & Associates, LLC and will be used for general expenses of the firm. Client further understands that it is ordinarily the client's option to deposit funds with an attorney that shall remain client's property as security for future services. However, Robert J. Semrad & Associates, LLC does not represent clients under such a security retainer because the preparation of a bankruptcy case requires many disparate tasks and functions for the attorney and support staff; some of which require legal expertise while others may be only ministerial in nature. Client further understands that the benefit that client is receiving under this fee arrangement is the commitment of Robert J. Semrad & Associates, LLC to perform any and all work reasonably necessary to represent client's interests absent any extraordinary circumstances.  In any application for fees, whether or not requiring an itemization, the attorney shall disclose to the court any fees paid by the debtor prior to the case filing.  4. Improper conduct by the attorney. If the debtor disputes the sufficiency or quality of the legal services provided or the amount of the fees charged by the attorney, the debtor may file an objection with the court and request a hearing.  5. Improper conduct by the debtor. If the attorney believes that the debtor is not complying with the debtor’s responsibilities under this agreement or is otherwise not engaging in proper conduct, the attorney may apply for a court order allowing the attorney to withdraw from the case.  6. Discharge of the attorney. The debtor may discharge the attorney at any time.

A—  UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS  NOTICE TO CONSUMER DEBTOR(S) UNDER § 342(b)  OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE  In accordance with § 342(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, this notice to individuals with primarily consumer debts: (l) Describes brieﬂy the services available from credit counseling services; (2) Describes brieﬂy the purposes, beneﬁts and costs of the four types of bankruptcy proceedings you may commence; and (3) Informs you about bankruptcy crimes and notifies you that the Attorney General may examine all information you supply in connection with a bankruptcy case.  You are cautioned that bankruptcy law is complicated and not easily described. Thus, you may wish to seek the advice of an attorney to learn of your rights and responsibilities should you decide to file a petition. Court employees cannot give you legal advice.  Notices from the bankruptcy court are sent to the mailing address you list on your bankruptcy petition. In order to ensure that you receive information about events concerning your case, Bankruptcy Rule 4002 requires that you notify the court of any changes in your address. If you are filing a joint case (a single bankruptcy case for two individuals married to each other), and each spouse lists the same mailing address on the bankruptcy petition, you and your spouse will generally receive a single copy of each notice mailed from the bankruptcy court in a jointly-addressed envelope, unless you file a statement with the court requesting that each spouse receive a separate copy of all notices.  1. Services Available from Credit Counseling Agencies  With limited exceptions, § 109(h) of the Bankruptcy Code requires that all individual debtors who file for bankruptcy relief on or after October 17, 2005, receive a briefing that outlines the available opportunities for credit counseling and provides assistance in performing a budget analysis. The briefing must be given within 180 days before the bankruptcy filing. The briefing may be provided individually or in a group (including briefings conducted by telephone or on the Internet) and must be provided by a nonproﬁt budget and credit counseling agency approved by the United States trustee or bankruptcy administrator. The clerk of the bankruptcy court has a list that you may consult of the approved budget and credit counseling agencies. Each debtor in a joint case must complete the briefing.     In addition, after filing a bankruptcy case, an individual debtor generally must complete a financial management instructional course before he or she can receive a discharge. The clerk also has a list of approved financial management instructional courses. Each debtor in a joint case must complete the course.  2. The Four Chapters of the Bankruptcy Code Available to Individual Consumer Debtors  Chapter 7: Liquidation ($245 ﬁling fee, $46 administrative fee, $15 trustee surcharge: Total Fee $306)  Chapter 7 is designed for debtors in financial difficulty who do not have the ability to pay their existing debts. Debtors whose debts are primarily consumer debts are subject to a \"means test\" designed to determine whether the case should be permitted to proceed under chapter 7. If your income is greater than the median income for your state of residence and family size, in some cases, the United States trustee (or bankruptcy administrator), the trustee, or creditors have the right to ﬁle a motion requesting that the court dismiss your case under § 707(b) of the Code. It is up to the court to decide whether the case should be dismissed.  Under chapter 7, you may claim certain of your property as exempt under governing law. A trustee may have the right to take possession of and sell the remaining property that is not exempt and use the sale proceeds to pay your creditors.  The purpose of filing a chapter 7 case is to obtain a discharge of your existing debts. If, however, you are found to have committed certain kinds of improper conduct described in the Bankruptcy Code, the court may deny your discharge and, if it does, the purpose for which you filed the bankruptcy petition will be defeated.  Even if you receive a general discharge, some particular debts are not discharged under the law. Therefore, you may still be responsible for most taxes and student loans; debts incurred to pay nondischargeable taxes; domestic support and property settlement obligations; most fines, penalties, forfeitures, and criminal restitution obligations; certain debts which are not properly listed in your bankruptcy papers; and debts for death or personal injury caused by operating a motor vehicle, vessel, or aircraft while intoxicated from alcohol or drugs. Also, if a creditor can prove that a debt arose from fraud, breach of ﬁduciary duty, or theft, or from a willful and malicious injury, the bankruptcy court may determine that the debt is not discharged.  Chapter 13: Repayment of All or Part of the Debts of an Individual with Regular Income ($235 filing fee,  (ID/IL nJm:n:A‘-nn‘-:vvn BAA. \"FAA-AI 3A,. ¢GO1\\ A VAAAA a _v4--, A .vu--v uu vu--uvu-;vA uvuuu;\\ul A ”0v _  a period of time. You are only eligible for chapter 13 if your debts do not exceed certain dollar amounts set forth in the Bankruptcy Code.  Under chapter 13, you must ﬁle with the court a plan to repay your creditors all or part of the money that you owe them, using your future earnings. The period allowed by the court to repay your debts may be three years or five years, depending upon your income and other factors. The court must approve your plan before it can take effect.  After completing the payments under your plan, your debts are generally discharged except for domestic support obligations; most student loans; certain taxes; most criminal fines and restitution obligations; certain debts which are not properly listed in your bankruptcy papers; certain debts for acts that caused death or personal injury; and certain long term secured obligations.  Chapter 11: Reorganization ($1,167 filing fee, $46 administrative fee: Total fee $1,213) Chapter 11 is designed for the reorganization of a business but is also available to consumer debtors. Its provisions are quite complicated, and any decision by an individual to file a chapter 11 petition should be reviewed with an attorney.  Chapter 12: Family Farmer or Fisherman ($200 filing fee, $46 administrative fee: Total fee $246)  Chapter 12 is designed to permit family farmers and fishermen to repay their debts over a period of time from future earnings and is similar to chapter 13. The eligibility requirements are restrictive, limiting its use to those whose income arises primarily from a family—owned farm or commercial fishing operation.  3. Bankruptcy Crimes and Availability of Bankruptcy Papers to Law Enforcement Ofﬁcials  A person who knowingly and fraudulently conceals assets or makes a false oath or statement under penalty of perjury, either orally or in writing, in connection with a bankruptcy case is subject to a fine, imprisonment, or both. All information supplied by a debtor in connection with a bankruptcy case is subject to examination by the Attorney General acting through the Ofﬁce of the United States Trustee, the Office of the United States Attorney, and other components and employees of the Department of Justice.  WARNING: Section 521(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code requires that you promptly file detailed information regarding your creditors, assets, liabilities, income, expenses and general financial condition. Your bankruptcy case may be dismissed if this information is not filed with the court within the time deadlines set by the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules, and the local rules of the court. The documents and the deadlines for filing them are listed on Form B200, which is posted at  http://www.uscourts.gov/bkforms/bankruptcy_forms.html#procedure.

Chapter 7 Retainer Agreement  The undersigned hires Geraci Law L.L.C. and its associated attorneys for representation in a Chapter? bankruptcy under the following terms and conditions:  Attorney fees for the Chapter 7 bankruptcy are $239013 . This amount does NOT INCLUDE court ﬁling fees of $335, or costs for credit counseling or ﬁnancial management classes. This fee is based on the anticipated amount of work required to complete my case, and upon the information I have provided to date. if any information is incomplete or incorrect, the advice or Chapter may have to change, and this fee may have to be adjusted. This fee includes all work in the representation of my normal Chapter7, including preparation of my bankruptcy petition, schedules and other documents, ﬁrst341 meeting, reaffirmations, normal correspondence with my creditors and myself, but does NOT include excessive work caused by you, missed341 meetings, reopening the case, amendments to schedules, work on audits or asset cases, objections to exemptions, conversion to another chapter, evidentiary hearings, other contested matters or motions, or adversary proceedings, because these cannot be predicted in setting a ﬂat fee. For work done on these matters, we bill between $275/hr and $450/hr for attorney time, based on the attorney doing the work, and $85 to $125/hr paralegal time. I agree that more than one attorney and paralegal will work on my case.  Fees are \"ﬂat fees\" and “advance payment retainers” for pre-ﬁling work, become property of this ﬁrm on payment, and are deposited into the ﬁrm’s operating account. Payments are applied to the “ﬂat fee”. You may elect to be billed on an hourly basis, but we have found a ﬂat fee is cheaper and beneﬁts you. if this contract is terminated by either party prior to the ﬁling of the case, the ﬁrm will refund unearned fees based on the above rates with an accounting, and on request, submit any dispute to binding arbitration within30 days. If I close my ﬁle or breach this contract I agree to pay for the work done to that time. i assign to my attorney all amounts tendered as ﬁling fees or court costs and authorize my attorney to transfer said funds from his trust account to his operating account in payment of all outstanding fees owed by me if case is not f led .  I understand that bankruptcy laws only allow me to protect a certain amount of my property, and if i have any unprotected property, i understand my Chapter 7 Trustee can sell it if I do not or cannot buy out the Trustee’s interest and that the US. Trustee may object to  my ﬁling a Chapter 7 if they believe I have excess income and should be ﬁling a Chapter‘l3.  I agree to fully cooperate with my attorneys and provide all information requested at any point during the case. I understand that if i do not fully cooperate or provide complete and accurate information, my attorneys may withdraw from representation of me, with the permission of the Court.  If I have secured debts that i wish to retain (mortgages, ﬁnanced vehicles or other ﬁnanced property) that I may be required to sign a reafﬁrmation agreement with the creditor in order to keep the property, and i must remain current on my payments Many mortgage and car companies refuse to reafﬁrm the debt but we have found that if you keep up your payments you keep the property anyway.  Debts not discharged if they not paid in full: student loans; educational debts & tuition; most tax debts: unﬁled, trust fund or late ﬁled tax; undisclosed debts; support/maintenance debts; ﬁnes, debts incurred by fraud, or after the case is ﬁled, future condo/HOA dues,or debts listed in your red or green folder as usually not discharged, or found non-dischargeable by a Judge.  Representation limited to Bankruptcy Court We don't represent you in state court, or loan modiﬁcations or similar matters.  I cannot transfer any property or incur any credit or debt without the express permission of my attorney or the Court and I must make full disclosure of all income, expenses, debts and assets in my initial consultation and on my bankruptcy petition.  I understand that if i fall to take my ﬁnancial management class after ﬁling but before discharge, my case may be closed without a discharge, and i will be required to pay fees and costs to have it reopened. l have received the 11U.S.C § 527(a) disclosures.

Dated: 10/19/2015 Isl Shaunte Domanique Cameron x Date & Sign  Shaunte Domanique Cameron UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT  NOTICE TO CONSUMER DEBTOR(S) UNDER §342(b)  OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE  In accordance with § 342(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, this notice to individuals with primarily consumer debts: (l) Describes brieﬂy the services available from credit counseling services; (2) Describes brieﬂy the purposes, beneﬁts and costs of the four types of bankruptcy proceedings you may commence; and (3) Informs you about bankruptcy crimes and notiﬁes you that the Attorney General may examine all information you supply in connection with a bankruptcy case.  You are cautioned that bankruptcy law is complicated and not easily described. Thus, you may wish to seek the advice of an attorney to learn of your rights and responsibilities should you decide to ﬁle a petition. Court employees cannot give you legal advice.  Notices from the bankruptcy court are sent to the mailing address you list on your bankruptcy petition. In order to ensure that you receive information about events concerning your case, Bankruptcy Rule 4002 requires that you notify the court of any changes in your address. If you are ﬁling a joint case (a single bankruptcy case for two individuals married to each other), and each spouse lists the same mailing address on the bankruptcy petition, you and your spouse will generally receive a single copy of each notice mailed from the bankruptcy court in a jointly- addressed envelope, unless you ﬁle a statement with the court requesting that each spouse receive a separate copy of all notices.  1. Services Available from Credit Counseling Agencies  With limited exceptions, § 109(h) of the Bankruptcy Code requires that all individual debtors who ﬁle for bankruptcy relief on or after October 17, 2005, receive a brieﬁng that outlines the available opportunities for credit counseling and provides assistance in performing a budget analysis. The brieﬁng must be given within 180 days before the bankruptcy ﬁling. The brieﬁng may be provided individually or in a group (including brieﬁngs conducted by telephone or on the Internet) and must be provided by a nonproﬁt budget and credit counseling agency approved by the United States trustee or bankruptcy administrator. The clerk of the bankruptcy court has a list that you may consult of the approved budget and credit counseling agencies. Each debtor in a joint case must complete the brieﬁng.     In addition, after ﬁling a bankruptcy case, an individual debtor generally must complete a ﬁnancial  management instructional course before he or she can receive a discharge. The clerk also has a list of approved ﬁnancial management instructional courses. Each debtor in a joint case must complete the course.  2. The Four Chapters of the Bankruptcy Code Available to Individual Consumer Debtors  Chapter 7: Liquidation ($245 ﬁling fee, $75 administrative fee, $15 trustee surcharge: Total fee $335 Chapter 7 is designed for debtors in ﬁnancial difﬁculty who do not have the ability to pay their existing  debts. Debtors whose debts are primarily consumer debts are subject to a “means test” designed to determine whether the case should be permitted to proceed under chapter 7. If your income is greater than the median income for your state of residence and family size, in some cases, the United States trustee (or bankruptcy administrator), the trustee, or creditors have the right to ﬁle a motion requesting that the court dismiss your case under § 707(b) of the Code. It is up to the court to decide whether the case should be dismissed.  Under chapter 7, you may claim certain of your property as exempt under governing law. A trustee may have the right to take possession of and sell the remaining property that is not exempt and use the sale proceeds to pay your creditors.  The purpose of ﬁling a chapter 7 case is to obtain a discharge of vour existing debts. If. however. vou are luv  nus  UL:  found to have committed certain kinds of improper conduct described in the Bankruptcy Code, the court may deny your  discharge and, if it does, the purpose for which you ﬁled the bankruptcy petition will be defeated.  Even if you receive a general discharge, some particular debts are not discharged under the law. Therefore, you may still be responsible for most taxes and student loans; debts incurred to pay nondischargeable taxes; domestic support and property settlement obligations; most ﬁnes, penalties, forfeitures, and criminal restitution obligations; certain debts which are not properly listed in your bankruptcy papers; and debts for death or personal injury caused by operating a motor vehicle, vessel, or aircraft while intoxicated from alcohol or drugs. Also, if a creditor can prove that a debt arose from fraud, breach of ﬁduciary duty, or theft, or from a willful and malicious injury, the bankruptcy court may determine that the debt is not discharged.  Chapter 13: Repayment of All or Part of the Debts of an Individual with Regular Income ($235 ﬁling fee, $75 administrative fee: Total fee $310)  Chapter 13 is designed for individuals with regular income who would like to pay all or part of their debts in installments over a period of time. You are only eligible for chapter 13 if your debts do not exceed certain dollar amounts set forth in the Bankruptcy Code.  Under chapter 13, you must ﬁle with the court a plan to repay your creditors all or part of the money that you owe them, using your future earnings. The period allowed by the court to repay your debts may be three years or five years, depending upon your income and other factors. The court must approve your plan before it can take effect.  After completing the payments under your plan, your debts are generally discharged except for domestic support obligations; most student loans; certain taxes; most criminal ﬁnes and restitution obligations; certain debts which are not properly listed in your bankruptcy papers; certain debts for acts that caused death or personal injury; and certain long term secured obligations.  Chapter 11: Reorganization ($1,167 ﬁling fee, $550 administrative fee: Total fee $1,717)  Chapter 11 is designed for the reorganization of a business but is also available to consumer debtors. Its provisions are quite complicated, and any decision by an individual to ﬁle a chapter 11 petition should be reviewed with an attorney.  Chapter 12: Family Farmer or Fisherman ($200 ﬁling fee, $75 administrative fee: Total fee $275)  Chapter 12 is designed to permit family farmers and ﬁshermen to repay their debts over a period of time from future earnings and is similar to chapter 13. The eligibility requirements are restrictive, limiting its use to those whose income arises primarily from a family-owned farm or commercial ﬁshing operation.  3. Bankruptcy Crimes and Availability of Bankruptcy Papers to Law Enforcement Ofﬁcials  A person who knowingly and fraudulently conceals assets or makes a false oath or statement under penalty of perjury, either orally or in writing, in connection with a bankruptcy case is subject to a ﬁne, imprisonment, or both. All information supplied by a debtor in connection with a bankruptcy case is subject to examination by the Attorney General acting through the Ofﬁce of the United States Trustee, the Ofﬁce of the United States Attorney, and other components and employees of the Department of Justice.  WARNING: Section 521(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code requires that you promptly ﬁle detailed information regarding your creditors, assets, liabilities, income, expenses and general ﬁnancial condition. Your bankruptcy case may be dismissed if this information is not ﬁled with the court within the time deadlines set by the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules, and the local rules of the court.

      "IN THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  In re: ) Chapter 11 NEWPAGE CORPORATION, et al., i Case No. 11—12804(KG)  Reorganized Debtors. i m 3 AS LITIGATION TRUSTEE OF THE ) NP CREDITOR LITIGATION TRUST, )  Plaintiff, i  V. i Adv. Proc. No. 13-52443(KG)  STYRON LLC 3  Defendant. i Re Dkt N0. 19 & 25  MEMORANDUM OPINION The Court has before it cross-motions for partial summary judgment in this interesting adversary proceeding. Pirinate Consulting Group, LLC, as Liquidation Trustee of the NP Creditor Liquidation Trust (the “Trustee”), has brought suit against Styron LLC (“Styron”), to avoid and recover $11,788,000.85 in transfers which debtors NewPage Corporation and NewPage Wisconsin Systems Inc. (together, “Debtors”) made to Styron during the ninety days immediately prior to Debtors’ bankruptcy filing, i.e. , June 9 through September 6, 201 1  (the “Preference Period)1. Debtors filed for bankruptcy on September 7, 2011 (the “Petition  1 The Court is addressing only that portion of the claim which the partial summary judgment Date”). The parties’ basic contentions are these: (1) Styron argues that it is entitled to use as part of its new value defense all unpaid invoices as of the Petition Date and which were paid post-petition when Styron drew on a letter of credit at a third-party bank; (2) the Trustee contends that as a creditor that drew on a collateralized letter of credit to satisfy invoices,  Styron is not entitled to an “unpaid new value” credit because it did not enrich Debtors’  estate.  Facts     Styron and Debtors began doing business together in June 2010, when Styron purchased a division of Dow Chemical that had been selling chemicals and related material to Debtors. Styron continued such sales. Affidavit of Michael Loughery, 11 7 (“Loughery Aff.”) (D.I. 19, Attachment 2) (Senior Financial Analyst of Styron).  Styron became a beneficiary on September 15, 2010, to a letter of credit (the “‘LOC”) which was originally issued to Debtors on July 20, 2009. Id., 11 10. At that time, Debtors posted the LOC for the benefit of Dow Chemical in the amount of $2 million. Later, Debtors  substituted Styron for Dow Chemical as beneficiary and increased the LOC to $3 million.  161., EX. 2.  The LOC, according to Debtors, was issued pursuant to the Revolving Credit and Guaranty Credit Agreement, dated December 21, 2011, for which Debtors were borrowers. Debtors had $101 million in letters of credit issued but not drawn as of June 30, 2011. Declaration of George F. Martin in Support of Debtors’ First Day Motions and Applications,  11 9 (“First Day Decl.”) (D.I. 3, Chapter 11 Case). Wachovia Bank, N.A.2, was an issuing bank for letters of credit. Debtors granted a first priority lien on all cash, receivables, inventory and the like to secure their obligations. Debtors were required to reimburse amounts drawn on letters of credit. The letters of credit, including the LOC, were fully collateralized. When Wells Fargo honored a draw on the LOC, and other letters of credit, it immediately notified Debtors who then reimbursed Wells Fargo. The procedure for a Styron draw required Styron to present a statement, “invoice(s) have not been paid and are past due. We therefore demand payment in the amount of (insert amount) as same is due and owing.” The LOC terms limited draws to past due invoices. Loughery Aff., 1] 11.  From April 2010 to August 26, 2011, Debtors paid Styron’s invoices on an average of fourteen days after Styron issued an invoice. On August 26, 2011, Styron changed the payment terms to require cash in advance because Styron was worried about Debtors’ credit position. Email from Michael Loughery, dated August 26, 201 l. Debtors and Styron agreed to reduce the $3 million LOC by $200,000. Email from Timothy Musbaum to Styron, dated  August 28, 2011.  2 Wachovia Bank, NA, merged with and into Wells Fargo Bank, NA. (“Wells Fargo”) on March 20, 2010. Accordingly, hereafter the Court will refer to the issuing bank as “Wells Fargo.” Between August 30, 2011, and just prior to the Petition Date, Debtors made the  following cash in advance payments:  Cash-in-Advance Payments  Check Number Transfer Type Clear Date Check Amounts  2003049517 ACH 8/30/2011 $2,159,720.69  2003051916 Wire 9/1/2011 $2,485.27 | 2003052949 | Wire 9/6/2011 $1,141,718.38  | TOTAL: $3,303,924.34  Debtors also made the following payments:  l Check Number l TransferT e Clear Date Check Amounts  2000148437 ACH 8/26/2011 $_261 431 48 2000196637 ACH 8/26/2011 _177 247. 57 2000208906 ACH 8/26/2011 $126 580. 77  2000263725 8/26/2011 $211 278. 31  | TOTAL. _776, 538.13  Following the foregoing payments, Debtors had outstanding invoices from Styron totaling $1,920,769.35.

Jurisdiction and Venue3 This Court has subject matter j urisdiction over this adversary proceeding, which arises under title 11 of the United States Code and arises in and relates to the Chapter 11 Cases  commenced in the Court. The statutory predicates for the relief sought herein are sections  502, 547, and 550 of the Bankruptcy Code and Rules 3007 and 7001 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.  The adversary proceeding is a core proceeding to be heard and determined by the Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 157(b), and the Court may enter final orders for matters  contained herein. Venue is proper in the District of Delaware pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1408  and 1409.  B. Standards for Summary Judgment  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a), made applicable to this adversary proceeding through Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7056, a court may grant summary judgment where “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A material fact is one  that”might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.” Anderson v. Liberty  3 Styron explains in its motion papers that because it never ﬁled a proof of claim in Debtors’ cases, Styron is entitled to a jury trial and has until October 31, 2014, to withdraw the reference. Styron further explains, and the Court concurs, that the Court retains jurisdiction for the pretrial matters, including disposition motions, and that such a ruling does not deprive Styron of its jury trial right. The issue is academic at this time, however, because Styron is a movant and has not yet requested a ruling on the jury trial issue. Lobby, Inc. , 477 US. 242, 248 (1986). A dispute regarding a material fact is genuine “where reasonable minds could disagree on the result.” Delta Mills, Inc. v. GMAC Comm. F in., Inc. (In re Delta Mills, Inc.), 404 BR. 95, 105 (Bankr. D. Del. 2009). The moving party bears the burden of demonstrating an entitlement to summary judgement. MeAnaney v. Astoria Fin. Corp, 665 F. Supp. 2d 132, 141 (E.D.N.Y. 2009).  At the summary judgment stage, a court’s function is not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter, but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S., 317, 322 (1986); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). In making this determination, a court must view all facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and must draw all reasonable inferences from the underlying facts in favor of the non-movant. McAnaney, 665 F. Supp. 2d at 141; Pastore v. Bell Tel. C0. of Pa, 24 F.3d 508, 512 (3d Cir. 1994). Any doubt must also be construed in the non-moving party’s favor. Delta Mills, 404 HR. at 105.  Once the moving party provides sufficient evidence, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to rebut the evidence. Delta Mills, 404 BR. at 105. The non-moving party “must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.” McAnaney, 665 F. Supp. 2d at 141 (quoting Caldarola v. Calabrese, 298 F.2d 156, 160 (2d Cir. 2002)). “[T]he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties” cannot defeat a properly supported summary judgment motion. Anderson, 477 US. at 247-48. The dispute must relate to a genuine issue of material fact. Delta Mills, 404 BR.  at 105 . Thus, a non-moving party cannot defeat a summary judgment motion based on conclusory allegations and denials, but instead must provide supportive arguments or facts that show the necessity of a trial. McAnaney, 665 F. Supp. 2d at 141. Summary judgment should be granted if, after drawing all reasonable inferences from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, the court concludes that there is no genuine issue of material fact to be resolved at trial and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  The standards governing summary judgment apply to cross-motions. Williams v. Philadelphia Hous. Auth, 834 F.Supp. 794, 797 (E.D.Pa. 1993). The Court must review the motions independently. Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. Utilicorp United, 928 F.Supp. 466, 470 (D.Del. 1996). Cross-motions may seem to represent that the parties agree that there are no material issues of facts, but the Court is neither bound to “the implicit agreement” nor required to enter judgment for either party.” Enron Corp. v. Whalen (In re Enron Corp), 351 BR. 305, 310 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2006).  C. Merits     A “preference” is a transfer to a creditor which a debtor makes immediately prior to a bankruptcy whereby the creditor receives payment in full and other creditors have no such  assurance. Friedman’s Inc. v. Roth Staﬂing Companies, L.P. (In re Friedman ’s Ine.), Adv.  No. 09-10161, 2011 WL 5975283, *2 (Bankr. D. Del. Nov. 30, 2011), aﬂ’d sub nom. Friedman’s Liquidating Trust v. Roth Staﬂing Companies, L.P. , 738 F.3d 547 (3d Cir. 2013). The siX requirements that the Trustee must establish to make a preference voidable  are: (1) a transfer is made; (2) on account of antecedent debt; (3) to or for the benefit of the creditor; (4) while the debtor was insolvent; (5) within 90 days of the filing of the petition; (6) that left the creditor better off than it would have been if the transfer had not been made and it had asserted its claim in a chapter 7 liquidation. ll U.S.C. § 547(b). A defense to a preference claim is for “subsequent new value” which limits or  eliminates liability under Section 547(b). Pursuant to Section 547(c)(4)(B).  [t]he trustee may not avoid under this section a transfer. . .to or  for the benefit of a creditor, to the extent that, after such transfer,  such creditor gave new value to or for the benefit of the debtor.  . . on account of which new value the debtor did not make an  otherwise unavoidable transfer to or for the benefit of such creditor.  ll U.S.C. § 547(c)(4)(B). “New Value” is defined under section 547(a)(2) as “money or money’s worth in goods, services, or new credit. . . that is neither void nor voidable by the debtor or the trustee under any applicable law.” 11 U.S.C. § 547(a).  There are important policy considerations for the subsequent new value defense. It encourages creditors to continue to help a troubled business; and, it prevents or limits the trustee from avoiding all transfers during the preference period where a creditor has benefitted the debtor and, consequently, its other creditors. See, e.g., Friedman ’S, 2011 WL 5975283 at *2. To qualify for the defense, the transfer must not have harmed the debtor’s estate. A transfer which meets the delineated requirements, namely, it was made in exchange for new value and the transfer adds value to the estate in an amount equal to the transfer, means the debtor’s estate suffers no diminution. In such circumstance, the debtor’s estate  suffers no injury. Styron argues that it is entitled to the new value defense for all invoices unpaid as of the Petition Period and subsequently paid post petition when Styron drew on the LOC. Styron reasons that: (a) it provided goods on an unsecured basis, (b) the transfers in question occurred before Styron shipped the goods covered in the invoices, and (c) the LOC was not property of Debtors’ estate. It is fair to say that Styron relies principally on a recent decision of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, viZ., Friedman ’S Liquidating T rust v. Roth Staﬂing Companies LP, 738 F.3d 547 (3d Cir. 2013). Debtor, Friedman’s, issued payments to Roth totaling $82,000 during the preference period. Following the bankruptcy filing, the Court entered a wage order on debtor’s motion and Friedman’s paid Roth $72,412.71 on account of prepetition staffing services (Roth provided Friedman’s with its staff). The liquidating trustee made a preference claim for other prepetion payments (totaling $8 1,997.57), and Roth asserted a subsequent new value defense, claiming that it provided new value ($100,660.88) which exceeded the preference claim. The liquidating trustee, in turn, argued that Roth could not use the post-petition payment ($72,412.71) it received pursuant to the wage order. The Third Circuit did not agree with Freidman’s and held that the post-petition payment did not negate the new value defense.  The Third Circuit discussed and compared cases arriving at contrary conclusions. After discussing the statutory rules of construction and the statutory scheme of preference  claims, the Third Circuit turned to policy considerations. The policy considerations, quoting from Union Bank v. Wolas, 502 U.S. 151, 161 (1991) (in turn, quoting from HR. Rep. No.  95—595, at 177—178), are: First, by permitting the trustee to avoid pre-bankruptcy transfers that occur within a short period before bankruptcy, creditors are discouraged from racing to the courthouse to dismember the debtor during his slide into bankruptcy. The protection thus afforded the debtor often enables him to work his way out of a  difficult financial situation through cooperation with all of his creditors. Second, and more important, the preference provisions facilitate the prime bankruptcy policy of equality of distribution among creditors of the debtor. The Third Circuit concluded that (l) replenishment of a debtor can occur even when a postpetition payment is for new value the creditor provided pre-petition (2) there must be a cutoff of the preference analysis at the petition date, and (3) this cut-off does not impair equal treatment of all creditors because at such time all matters are under a bankruptcy court’s supervision, at which point the debtor is under the scrutiny of the court, creditors, a committee and the United States Trustee. Friedman ’S, 738 F.3d at 560—61. In response, the Trustee distinguishes Friedman ’S in several respects; (1) Roth did not change the terms of the engagement pre-petition. (2) Friedman’s made the post-petition payment to Roth pursuant to a court order, i. e. , the wage order. (3) The Third Circuit distinguished post-petition payments made on a critical vendor motion from payments made on account of a reclamation claim. The difference arises from the policy of not rewarding the “race of diligence.”  (4) Styron did not seek the Court’s authority to draw on the LOC, in contrast to the  wage order in Friedman ’s. It is important, as well, to discuss, in the context of policy, the Third Circuit’s discussion in Friedman’s of its decision in Kimmelman v. PortAutlz. Of New York & New Jersey (In re Kiwi Int’l Air Lines, Inc), 344 F.3d 311 (3d Cir. 2003). Although the Court recognized Kiwi Air was not directly applicable to Friedman’s, id. at 562, the Third Circuit  explained as follows:  In Kiwi Air, we held that the post-petition assumption of an executory contract under § 365 and a stipulated order pursuant to § 1110, which both require a trustee to cure certain defaults, preclude a trustee from bringing a preference action to recover pre-petition payments made pursuant to the contract. . . . If anything, Kiwi Air teaches that post-petition events can cast the payment in a different light in order to effectuate the purposes and provisions of the Code.  Kiwi Air demonstrates that there are unique circumstances in which other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code dealing with  post—petition transactions directly interact with § 547 and thus can alter the otherwise straightforward preference analysis.  Friedman’s, 738 F.3d at 562.  The law is thus clear that the bankruptcy filing fixed the preference analysis as of the Petition Date. It is equally clear that under normal circumstances, a letter of credit is not property of a debtor’s estate. See, e.g., Kellogg 12. Blue Quail Energy Corp. (Matter of Compton Corp.), 831 F.2d 586, 589 (5th Cir. 1987), relz ’g granted, 835 F.2d 584 (1988), which the Third Circuit cited in its decision in Int ’l F inanee Corp. v. Kaiser Group Int ’l, Inc. , 399 F.3d 558 (3d Cir. 2005), which again held that letters of credit are not property of a debtor’s estate. The Compton decision, however, goes beyond that simple explication of the  law. In explaining the “well established” rule of bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit in Compton stated that an issuer honoring a draft on a letter of credit does so from its own assets, not those of the customer, and, as a result, a trustee cannot enjoin post-petition payments from the letter of credit. Compton, 831 F.2d at 589. The Fifth Circuit further explained that the independence principle of credit law renders any disputes between the beneficiary and customer separate from the issuer’s obligation to pay the beneficiary. Compton, 831 F.2d at 590. However, the Fifth Circuit further reasoned that “the letter of credit itself and the payments thereunder may not be property of the debtor, but the collateral pledged as a security interest for the letter of credit is.” Compton, 831 F.2d at 590-91. The Fifth Circuit also noted that “it is not necessary that the transfer be made directly to the creditor... [if] the effect of which is to enable one of his creditors to obtain a greater percentage of his debt than another creditor of the same class, circuity of arrangement will not avail to save it.” Compton, 831 F.2d at 591 (quoting Nat’l Bank of Newport 12. Nat’l Herkimer County Bank, 225 U.S. 178, 184 (1912)). The Compton court summarized its ruling as follows:  The precise holding in this case needs to be emphasized. We do  not hold that payments under a letter of credit, or even a letter of credit itself, constitute preferential transfers under 11 U.S.C. § 547(b) or property under U.S.C. § 541. The holding of this case fully allows the letter of credit to function. We preserve its sanctity and the underlying independence doctrine. We do not, however, allow an unsecured creditor to avoid a preference attack by utilizing a letter of credit to secure payment of an antecedent debt. Otherwise the unsecured creditor would receive an indirect preferential transfer from the granting of the security for the letter of credit to extent of the value of that security. Our holding does not affect the strength of or the proper use of letters of credit. When a letter of credit is issued contemporaneously with a new extension of credit, the creditor beneficiary will not be subject to a preferential attack under the direct/indirect doctrine elaborated in this case because the creditor will have given new value in exchange for the indirect benefit of the secured letter of credit. Only when a creditor receives a secured letter of credit to cover an unsecured antecedent debt will it be subject to a preferential attack under  11 U.S.C. § 547(b). Id, 831 F.2d at 594.  Here, the parties do not dispute any material facts. Styron either admits the truth of the allegation in the Complaint that the LOC was secured, or assumes the truth for purposes of the pending cross-motions. However, neither party can show that, as a matter of law, it is entitled to partial summary judgment on the new value defense. Following the Third Circuit’s decision in Friedman ’5, it is clear that a court-authorized post-petition payment by the debtor does not affect a creditor’s new value defense. However, it is not clear whether the same protection is available to a creditor who, on its own volition, takes action to draw on a letter of credit that, ultimately, has the effect of depleting property of the estate.  It is likewise clear that a letter of credit, itself, is not property of the estate. However, it is often secured by property that does belong to the estate. The case law is not settled as to the interaction between Section 547(c)(4)(A) and an indirect security interest, particularly on these facts, where the draw on the letter of credit almost immediately reduced the value of the property of the estate by triggering the nearly immediate repayment of the draw and associated fees. The Supreme Court has already cautioned against this type of indirect  arrangement which has the effect of a creditor’ s recovery greater than other similarly situated creditors.  Further, on the facts there appears to be a disputed and potentially material issue of fact. Did Styron receive payment based upon more onerous payment terms despite the parties’ long standing relationship? According to the Trustee on August 26, 201 1, during the Preference Period, Styron reduced the time for payment from 14 days to cash in advance. If so, does the Styron’s “diligence” negate the policy reasons for allowing the new value defense? See Union Bank, 502 US. at 161. The Court is also mindful of the Kiwi Air suggestion that the preference analysis might be altered by “unique circumstances.” Friedman ’S, 738 F.3d at 562. It remains to be determined whether Styron’s conduct — the changing of payment terms and the post-petition draw on the LOC — bar the new value defense which Styron asserts.  The Court must deny the cross-motions for further development of the facts and corresponding legal arguments. First, it is unclear to the Court whether Styron did impose new payment terms, and the legal effect of any such changes. Second, because the LOC was  secured and the draws diminished the estate, was Styron obligated to seek the Court’s approval for the post-petition draws? Third, despite Styron’s concession for purposes of its  motion, the Court wants to determine for itself whether the LOC was secured. Accordingly,  EQLAgVCA/S  KEVIN GROSS, U.S.B.J.  the Court will deny both motions.  Dated: October 1, 2014\n"
