A married couple may file a bankruptcy case together-called a joint case-and in joint cases, these forms use you to ask for information from both debtors. For example, if a form asks, ﬁDo you own a car,ﬂ the answer would be yes if either debtor owns a car. When information is needed about the spouses separately, the form uses Debtor 1 and Debtor 2 to distinguish between them. In joint cases, one of the spouses must report information as Debtor 1 and the other as Debtor 2. The same person must be Debtor 1 in all of the forms.Be as complete and accurate as possible. If two married people are filing together, both are equally responsible for supplying correct information. If more space is needed, attach a separate sheet to this form.

If two married people are filing together, both are equally responsible for supplying correct information. Using the property you listed on Schedule A/B: Property (Official Form 106A/B) as your source, list the property that you claim as exempt. If more space is needed, fill out and attach to this page as many copies of Part 2: Additional Page as necessary. On the top of any additional pages, write your name and case number (if known).For each item of property you claim as exempt, you must specify the amount of the exemption you claim. One way of doing so is to state a specific dollar amount as exempt. Alternatively, you may claim the full fair market value of the property being exempted up to the amount of any applicable statutory limit. Some exemptions-such as those for health aids, rights to receive certain benefits, and tax-exempt retirement funds-may be unlimited in dollar amount. However, if you claim an exemption of 100% of fair market value under a law that limits the exemption to a particular dollar amount and the value of the property is determined to exceed that amount, your exemption would be limited to the applicable statutory amount.1.  Which set of exemptions are you claiming? Check one only, even if your spouse is filing with you.  You are claiming state and federal nonbankruptcy exemptions. 11 U.S.C. § 522(b)(3)    You are claiming federal exemptions. 11 U.S.C. § 522(b)(2)2.

If, however, you arefound to have committed certain kinds of improper conduct described in the Bankruptcy Code, the court may deny your \n",
      "discharge and, if it does, the purpose for which you filed the bankruptcy petition will be defeated.Even if you receive a general discharge, some particular debts are not discharged under the law. Therefore, you may still be responsible for most taxes and student loans; debts incurred to pay nondischargeable taxes; domestic support and property settlement obligations; most fines, penalties, forfeitures, and criminal restitution obligations; certain debts which are not properly listed in your bankruptcy papers; and debts for death or personal injury caused by operating a motor vehicle, vessel, or aircraft while intoxicated from alcohol or drugs.  Also, if a creditor can prove that a debt arose from fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, or theft, or from a willful and malicious injury, the bankruptcy court may determine that the debt is not discharged.Chapter 13:  Repayment of All or Part of the Debts of an Individual with Regular Income ($235 filingfee, $75 administrative fee: Total fee $310)Chapter 13 is designed for individuals with regular income who would like to pay all or part of their debts in installments over a period of time.  You are only eligible for chapter 13 if your debts do not exceed certain dollar amounts set forth in the Bankruptcy Code.Under chapter 13, you must file with the court a plan to repay your creditors all or part of the money that you owe them, using your future earnings.  The period allowed by the court to repay your debts may be three years or five years, depending upon your income and other factors.  The court must approve your plan before it can take effect.After completing the payments under your plan, your debts are generally discharged except for domestic support obligations; most student loans; certain taxes; most criminal fines and restitution obligations; certain debts which are not properly listed in your bankruptcy papers; certain debts for acts that caused death or personal injury; and certain long term secured obligations.Chapter 11:  Reorganization ($1,167 filing fee, $550 administrative fee: Total fee $1,717)Chapter 11 is designed for the reorganization of a business but is also available to consumer debtors. Its provisions are quite complicated, and any decision by an individual to file a chapter 11 petition should be reviewed with an attorney.Chapter 12:  Family Farmer or Fisherman ($200 filing fee, $75 administrative fee: Total fee $275)Chapter 12 is designed to permit family farmers and fishermen to repay their debts over a period of time fromfuture earnings and is similar to chapter 13. The eligibility requirements are restrictive, limiting its use to those whose income arises primarily from a family-owned farm or commercial fishing operation.3. Bankruptcy Crimes and Availability of Bankruptcy Papers to Law Enforcement OfficialsA person who knowingly and fraudulently conceals assets or makes a false oath or statement under penaltyof perjury, either orally or in writing, in connection with a bankruptcy case is subject to a fine, imprisonment, or both.  All information supplied by a debtor in connection with a bankruptcy case is subject to examination by the Attorney General acting through the Office of the United States Trustee, the Office of the United States Attorney, and other components and employees of the Department of Justice.WARNING: Section 521(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code requires that you promptly file detailed information regarding your creditors, assets, liabilities, income, expenses and general financial condition. Your bankruptcy case may be dismissed if this information is not filed with the court within the time deadlines set by the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules, and the local rules of the court.

      " IN THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURTFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWAREIn re:)Chapter 11)NEWPAGE CORPORATION, et al.,)Case No. 11-12804(KG))Reorganized Debtors.)______________________________________ )PIRINATE CONSULTING GROUP, LLC,) AS LITIGATION TRUSTEE OF THE )NP CREDITOR LITIGATION TRUST,))Plaintiff,))v.)Adv. Proc. No. 13-52443(KG))STYRON LLC))Defendant.)Re Dkt No. 19 & 25_______________________________________)MEMORANDUM OPINIONThe Court has before it cross-motions for partial summary judgment in this interestingadversary proceeding.  Pirinate Consulting Group, LLC, as Liquidation Trustee of the NPCreditor Liquidation Trust (the ﬁTrusteeﬂ), has brought suit against Styron LLC (ﬁStyronﬂ),to avoid and recover $11,788,000.85 in transfers which debtors NewPage Corporation andNewPage Wisconsin Systems Inc. (together, ﬁDebtorsﬂ) made to Styron during the ninetydays immediately prior to Debtors™ bankruptcy filing, i.e., June 9 through September 6, 2011(the ﬁPreference Period)1.  Debtors filed for bankruptcy on September 7, 2011 (the ﬁPetition1  The Court is addressing only that portion of the claim which the partial summary judgmentcross-motions entail, namely, the post-petition draw on the letter of credit, discussed infra.Case 13-52443-KG    Doc 34    Filed 10/01/14    Page 1 of 14 Dateﬂ).  The parties™ basic contentions are these: (1) Styron argues that it is entitled to useas part of its new value defense all unpaid invoices as of the Petition Date and which werepaid post-petition when Styron drew on a letter of credit at a third-party bank; (2) the Trusteecontends that as a creditor that drew on a collateralized letter of credit to satisfy invoices,Styron is not entitled to an ﬁunpaid new valueﬂ credit because it did not enrich Debtors™estate.FactsStyron and Debtors began doing business together in June 2010, when Styronpurchased a division of Dow Chemical that had been selling chemicals and related materialto Debtors.  Styron continued such sales.  Affidavit of Michael Loughery, ¶ 7 (ﬁLougheryAff.ﬂ) (D.I. 19, Attachment 2) (Senior Financial Analyst of Styron).Styron became a beneficiary on September 15, 2010, to a letter of credit (the ﬁLOCﬂ)which was originally issued to Debtors on July 20, 2009.  Id., ¶ 10.  At that time, Debtorsposted the LOC for the benefit of Dow Chemical in the amount of $2 million.  Later, Debtorssubstituted Styron for Dow Chemical as beneficiary and increased the LOC to $3 million. Id., Ex. 2.The LOC, according to Debtors, was issued pursuant to the Revolving Credit andGuaranty Credit Agreement, dated December 21, 2011, for which Debtors were borrowers. Debtors had $101 million in letters of credit issued but not drawn as of June 30, 2011. Declaration of George F. Martin in Support of Debtors™ First Day Motions and Applications,¶ 9 (ﬁFirst Day Decl.ﬂ) (D.I. 3, Chapter 11 Case).2Case 13-52443-KG    Doc 34    Filed 10/01/14    Page 2 of 14 Wachovia Bank, N.A.2, was an issuing bank for letters of credit.  Debtors granted afirst priority lien on all cash, receivables, inventory and the like to secure their obligations. Debtors were required to reimburse amounts drawn on letters of credit.  The letters of credit,including the LOC, were fully collateralized.  When Wells Fargo honored a draw on theLOC, and other letters of credit, it immediately notified Debtors who then reimbursed WellsFargo.  The procedure for a Styron draw required Styron to present a statement, ﬁinvoice(s)have not been paid and are past due.  We therefore demand payment in the amount of (insertamount) as same is due and owing.ﬂ The LOC terms limited draws to past due invoices. Loughery Aff., ¶ 11.From April 2010 to August 26, 2011, Debtors paid Styron™s invoices on an averageof fourteen days after Styron issued an invoice.  On August 26, 2011, Styron changed thepayment terms to require cash in advance because Styron was worried about Debtors™ creditposition.  Email from Michael Loughery, dated August 26, 2011.  Debtors and Styron agreedto reduce the $3 million LOC by $200,000.  Email from Timothy Musbaum to Styron, datedAugust 28, 2011.2  Wachovia Bank, N.A., merged with and into Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (ﬁWells Fargoﬂ) onMarch 20, 2010.   Accordingly, hereafter the Court will refer to the issuing bank as ﬁWells Fargo.ﬂ3Case 13-52443-KG    Doc 34    Filed 10/01/14    Page 3 of 14 Between August 30, 2011, and just prior to the Petition Date, Debtors made thefollowing cash in advance payments:Cash-in-Advance Payments Check NumberTransfer TypeClear DateCheck Amounts 2003049517ACH8/30/2011$2,159,720.692003051916Wire9/1/2011       $2,485.272003052949Wire9/6/2011$1,141,718.38TOTAL:$3,303,924.34Debtors also made the following payments:Check NumberTransfer TypeClear DateCheck Amounts2000148437ACH8/26/2011$261,431,482000196637ACH8/26/2011$177,247.572000208906ACH8/26/2011$126,580.772000263725ACH8/26/2011$211,278.31TOTAL:$776,538.13Following the foregoing payments, Debtors had outstanding invoices from Styrontotaling $1,920,769.35.

Jurisdiction and Venue3This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this adversary proceeding, which arisesunder title 11 of the United States Code and arises in and relates to the Chapter 11 Cases commenced in the Court.  The statutory predicates for the relief sought herein are sections502, 547, and 550 of the Bankruptcy Code and Rules 3007 and 7001 of the Federal Rules ofBankruptcy Procedure.The adversary proceeding is a core proceeding to be heard and determined by theCourt pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 157(b), and the Court may enter final orders for matterscontained herein.  Venue is proper in the District of Delaware pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1408and 1409.B.  Standards for Summary JudgmentPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a), made applicable to this adversaryproceeding through Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7056, a court may grant summaryjudgment where ﬁthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant isentitled to judgment as a matter of law.ﬂ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  A material fact is onethatﬂmight affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.ﬂ  Anderson v. Liberty3  Styron explains in its motion papers that because it never filed a proof of claim in Debtors™cases, Styron is entitled to a jury trial and has until October 31, 2014, to withdraw the reference. Styron further explains, and the Court concurs, that the Court retains jurisdiction for the pretrialmatters, including disposition motions, and that such a ruling does not deprive Styron of its jury trialright.  The issue is academic at this time, however, because Styron is a movant and has not yetrequested a ruling on the jury trial issue.5Case 13-52443-KG    Doc 34    Filed 10/01/14    Page 5 of 14 Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  A dispute regarding a material fact is genuine ﬁwherereasonable minds could disagree on the result.ﬂ  Delta Mills, Inc. v. GMAC Comm. Fin., Inc.(In re Delta Mills, Inc.), 404 B.R. 95, 105 (Bankr. D. Del. 2009).  The moving party bearsthe burden of demonstrating an entitlement to summary judgement. McAnaney v. AstoriaFin. Corp., 665 F. Supp. 2d 132, 141 (E.D.N.Y. 2009).At the summary judgment stage, a court™s function is not to weigh the evidence anddetermine the truth of the matter, but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S., 317, 322 (1986); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  Inmaking this determination, a court must view all facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant and must draw all reasonable inferences from the underlying facts in favor of thenon-movant.  McAnaney, 665 F. Supp. 2d at 141; Pastore v. Bell Tel. Co. of Pa., 24 F.3d508, 512 (3d Cir. 1994).  Any doubt must also be construed in the non-moving party™s favor. Delta Mills, 404 B.R. at 105.Once the moving party provides sufficient evidence, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to rebut the evidence.  Delta Mills, 404 B.R. at 105.  The non-moving partyﬁmust do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the materialfacts.ﬂ  McAnaney, 665 F. Supp. 2d at 141 (quoting Caldarola v. Calabrese, 298 F.2d 156,160 (2d Cir. 2002)).  ﬁ[T]he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between thepartiesﬂ cannot defeat a properly supported summary judgment motion.  Anderson, 477 U.S.at 247-48.  The dispute must relate to a genuine issue of material fact.  Delta Mills, 404 B.R.at 105.  Thus, a non-moving party cannot defeat a summary judgment motion based on6Case 13-52443-KG    Doc 34    Filed 10/01/14    Page 6 of 14 conclusory allegations and denials, but instead must provide supportive arguments or factsthat show the necessity of a trial.  McAnaney, 665 F. Supp. 2d at 141.  Summary judgmentshould be granted if, after drawing all reasonable inferences from the underlying facts in thelight most favorable to the non-moving party, the court concludes that there is no genuineissue of material fact to be resolved at trial and the moving party is entitled to judgment asa matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).The standards governing summary judgment apply to cross-motions.  Williams v.Philadelphia Hous. Auth., 834 F.Supp. 794, 797 (E.D.Pa. 1993).  The Court must review themotions independently.  Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. Utilicorp United, 928 F.Supp.466, 470 (D.Del. 1996).  Cross-motions may seem to represent that the parties agree thatthere are no material issues of facts, but the Court is neither bound to ﬁthe implicitagreementﬂ nor required to enter judgment for either party.ﬂ  Enron Corp. v. Whalen (In reEnron Corp.), 351 B.R. 305, 310 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2006).C.  MeritsA ﬁpreferenceﬂ is a transfer to a creditor which a debtor makes immediately prior toa bankruptcy whereby the creditor receives payment in full and other creditors have no suchassurance.  Friedman™s Inc. v. Roth Staffing Companies, L.P. (In re Friedman™s Inc.), Adv.No. 09-10161, 2011 WL 5975283, *2 (Bankr. D. Del. Nov. 30, 2011), aff™d sub nom. Friedman™s Liquidating Trust v. Roth Staffing Companies, L.P., 738 F.3d 547 (3d Cir. 2013).The six requirements that the Trustee must establish to make a preference voidableare: (1) a transfer is made; (2) on account of antecedent debt; (3) to or for the benefit of the7Case 13-52443-KG    Doc 34    Filed 10/01/14    Page 7 of 14 creditor; (4) while the debtor was insolvent; (5) within 90 days of the filing of the petition;(6) that left the creditor better off than it would have been if the transfer had not been madeand it had asserted its claim in a chapter 7 liquidation.  11 U.S.C. § 547(b).A defense to a preference claim is for ﬁsubsequent new valueﬂ which limits oreliminates liability under Section 547(b).  Pursuant to Section 547(c)(4)(B).[t]he trustee may not avoid under this section a transfer. . .to orfor the benefit of a creditor, to the extent that, after such transfer,such creditor gave new value to or for the benefit of the debtor.. . on account of which new value the debtor did not make anotherwise unavoidable transfer to or for the benefit of suchcreditor.11 U.S.C. § 547(c)(4)(B).  ﬁNew Valueﬂ is defined under section 547(a)(2) as ﬁmoney ormoney™s worth in goods, services, or new credit. . . that is neither void nor voidable by thedebtor or the trustee under any applicable law.ﬂ  11 U.S.C. § 547(a).There are important policy considerations for the subsequent new value defense.  Itencourages creditors to continue to help a troubled business; and, it prevents or limits thetrustee from avoiding all transfers during the preference period where a creditor hasbenefitted the debtor and, consequently, its other creditors.  See, e.g., Friedman™s, 2011 WL5975283 at *2.  To qualify for the defense, the transfer must not have harmed the debtor™sestate.  A transfer which meets the delineated requirements, namely, it was made in exchangefor new value and the transfer adds value to the estate in an amount equal to the transfer,means the debtor™s estate suffers no diminution.  In such circumstance, the debtor™s estatesuffers no injury.8Case 13-52443-KG    Doc 34    Filed 10/01/14    Page 8 of 14 Styron argues that it is entitled to the new value defense for all invoices unpaid as ofthe Petition Period and subsequently paid post petition when Styron drew on the LOC. Styron reasons that: (a) it provided goods on an unsecured basis, (b) the transfers in questionoccurred before Styron shipped the goods covered in the invoices, and (c) the LOC was notproperty of Debtors™ estate.  It is fair to say that Styron relies principally on a recent decisionof the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, viz., Friedman™s Liquidating Trust v. Roth StaffingCompanies LP, 738 F.3d 547 (3d Cir. 2013).  Debtor, Friedman™s, issued payments to Rothtotaling $82,000 during the preference period.  Following the bankruptcy filing, the Courtentered a wage order on debtor™s motion and Friedman™s paid Roth $72,412.71 on accountof prepetition staffing services (Roth provided Friedman™s with its staff).  The liquidatingtrustee made a preference claim for other prepetion payments (totaling $81,997.57), and Rothasserted a subsequent new value defense, claiming that it provided new value ($100,660.88)which exceeded the preference claim.  The liquidating trustee, in turn, argued that Roth couldnot use the post-petition payment ($72,412.71) it received pursuant to the wage order.  TheThird Circuit did not agree with Freidman™s and held that the post-petition payment did notnegate the new value defense.The Third Circuit discussed and compared cases arriving at contrary conclusions. After discussing the statutory rules of construction and the statutory scheme of preferenceclaims, the Third Circuit turned to policy considerations.  The policy considerations, quotingfrom Union Bank v. Wolas, 502 U.S. 151, 161 (1991) (in turn, quoting from H.R. Rep. No.95-595, at 177-178), are:9Case 13-52443-KG    Doc 34    Filed 10/01/14    Page 9 of 14 First, by permitting the trustee to avoid pre-bankruptcy transfersthat occur within a short period before bankruptcy, creditors arediscouraged from racing to the courthouse to dismember thedebtor during his slide into bankruptcy.  The protection thusafforded the debtor often enables him to work his way out of adifficult financial situation through cooperation with all of hiscreditors. Second, and more important, the preference provisionsfacilitate the prime bankruptcy policy of equality of distributionamong creditors of the debtor.The Third Circuit concluded that (1) replenishment of a debtor can occur even when a post-petition payment is for new value the creditor provided pre-petition (2) there must be a cut-off of the preference analysis at the petition date, and (3) this cut-off does not impair equaltreatment of all creditors because at such time all matters are under a bankruptcy court™ssupervision, at which point the debtor is under the scrutiny of the court, creditors, acommittee and the United States Trustee.  Friedman™s, 738 F.3d at 560-61.In response, the Trustee distinguishes Friedman™s in several respects;(1) Roth did not change the terms of the engagement pre-petition.(2) Friedman™s made the post-petition payment to Roth pursuant to a court order, i.e.,the wage order.(3) The Third Circuit distinguished post-petition payments made on a critical vendormotion from payments made on account of a reclamation claim.  The difference arises fromthe policy of not rewarding the ﬁrace of diligence.ﬂ(4) Styron did not seek the Court™s authority to draw on the LOC, in contrast to thewage order in Friedman™s.10Case 13-52443-KG    Doc 34    Filed 10/01/14    Page 10 of 14 It is important, as well, to discuss, in the context of policy, the Third Circuit™sdiscussion in Friedman™s of its decision in Kimmelman v. Port Auth. Of New York & NewJersey (In re Kiwi Int™l Air Lines, Inc.), 344 F.3d 311 (3d Cir. 2003).  Although the Courtrecognized Kiwi Air was not directly applicable to Friedman™s, id. at 562, the Third Circuitexplained as follows:In Kiwi Air, we held that the post-petition assumption of anexecutory contract under § 365 and a stipulated order pursuantto § 1110, which both require a trustee to cure certain defaults,preclude a trustee from bringing a preference action to recoverpre-petition payments made pursuant to the contract. . . . Ifanything, Kiwi Air teaches that post-petition events can cast thepayment in a different light in order to effectuate the purposesand provisions of the Code.Kiwi Air demonstrates that there are unique circumstances inwhich other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code dealing withpost-petition transactions directly interact with § 547 and thuscan alter the otherwise straightforward preference analysis.Friedman™s, 738 F.3d at 562.The law is thus clear that the bankruptcy filing fixed the preference analysis as of thePetition Date.  It is equally clear that under normal circumstances, a letter of credit is notproperty of a debtor™s estate.  See, e.g., Kellogg v. Blue Quail Energy Corp. (Matter ofCompton Corp.), 831 F.2d 586, 589 (5th Cir. 1987), reh™g granted, 835 F.2d 584 (1988),which the Third Circuit cited in its decision in Int™l Finance Corp. v. Kaiser Group Int™l, Inc.,399 F.3d 558 (3d Cir. 2005), which again held that letters of credit are not property of adebtor™s estate.  The Compton decision, however, goes beyond that simple explication of thelaw.11Case 13-52443-KG    Doc 34    Filed 10/01/14    Page 11 of 14 In explaining the ﬁwell establishedﬂ rule of bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit inCompton stated that an issuer honoring a draft on a letter of credit does so from its ownassets, not those of the customer, and, as a result, a trustee cannot enjoin post-petitionpayments from the letter of credit. Compton, 831 F.2d at 589. The Fifth Circuit furtherexplained that the independence principle of credit law renders any disputes between thebeneficiary and customer separate from the issuer™s obligation to pay the beneficiary.Compton, 831 F.2d at 590. However, the Fifth Circuit further reasoned that ﬁthe letter ofcredit itself and the payments thereunder may not be property of the debtor, but the collateralpledged as a security interest for the letter of credit is.ﬂ Compton, 831 F.2d at 590-91. TheFifth Circuit also noted that ﬁit is not necessary that the transfer be made directly to thecreditor– [if] the effect of which is to enable one of his creditors to obtain a greaterpercentage of his debt than another creditor of the same class, circuity of arrangement willnot avail to save it.ﬂ Compton, 831 F.2d at 591 (quoting Nat™l Bank of Newport v. Nat™lHerkimer County Bank, 225 U.S. 178, 184 (1912)).  The Compton court summarized itsruling as follows:  The precise holding in this case needs to be emphasized.  We donot hold that payments under a letter of credit, or even a letter ofcredit itself, constitute preferential transfers under 11 U.S.C. §547(b) or property under U.S.C. § 541.  The holding of this casefully allows the letter of credit to function.  We preserve itssanctity and the underlying independence doctrine.  We do not,however, allow an unsecured creditor to avoid a preferenceattack by utilizing a letter of credit to secure payment of anantecedent debt.  Otherwise the unsecured creditor wouldreceive an indirect preferential transfer from the granting of thesecurity for the letter of credit to extent of the value of that12Case 13-52443-KG    Doc 34    Filed 10/01/14    Page 12 of 14 security.  Our holding does not affect the strength of or theproper use of letters of credit.  When a letter of credit is issuedcontemporaneously with a new extension of credit, the creditorbeneficiary will not be subject to a preferential attack under thedirect/indirect doctrine elaborated in this case because thecreditor will have given new value in exchange for the indirectbenefit of the secured letter of credit.  Only when a creditorreceives a secured letter of credit to cover an unsecuredantecedent debt will it be subject to a preferential attack under11 U.S.C. § 547(b).Id., 831 F.2d at 594.Here, the parties do not dispute any material facts. Styron either admits the truth ofthe allegation in the Complaint that the LOC was secured, or assumes the truth for purposesof the pending cross-motions.  However, neither party can show that, as a matter of law, itis entitled to partial summary judgment on the new value defense. Following the ThirdCircuit™s decision in Friedman™s, it is clear that a court-authorized post-petition payment bythe debtor does not affect a creditor™s new value defense. However, it is not clear whetherthe same protection is available to a creditor who, on its own volition, takes action to drawon a letter of credit that, ultimately, has the effect of depleting property of the estate. It is likewise clear that a letter of credit, itself, is not property of the estate. However,it is often secured by property that does belong to the estate. The case law is not settled asto the interaction between Section 547(c)(4)(A) and an indirect security interest, particularlyon these facts, where the draw on the letter of credit almost immediately reduced the valueof the property of the estate by triggering the nearly immediate repayment of the draw andassociated fees. The Supreme Court has already cautioned against this type of indirectarrangement which has the effect of a creditor™s recovery greater than other similarly situated13Case 13-52443-KG    Doc 34    Filed 10/01/14    Page 13 of 14 creditors.Further, on the facts there appears to be a disputed and potentially material issue offact.  Did Styron receive payment based upon more onerous payment terms despite theparties™ long standing relationship?  According to the Trustee on August 26, 2011, during thePreference Period, Styron reduced the time for payment from 14 days to cash in advance. If so, does the Styron™s ﬁdiligenceﬂ negate the policy reasons for allowing the new valuedefense?  See Union Bank, 502 U.S. at 161.  The Court is also mindful of the Kiwi Airsuggestion that the preference analysis might be altered by ﬁunique circumstances.ﬂ Friedman™s, 738 F.3d at 562.  It remains to be determined whether Styron™s conduct Œ thechanging of payment terms and the post-petition draw on the LOC Œ bar the new valuedefense which Styron asserts.  The Court must deny the cross-motions for further development of the facts andcorresponding legal arguments.  First, it is unclear to the Court whether Styron did imposenew payment terms, and the legal effect of any such changes.  Second, because the LOC wassecured and the draws diminished the estate, was Styron obligated to seek the Court™sapproval for the post-petition draws?  Third, despite Styron™s concession for purposes of itsmotion, the Court wants to determine for itself whether the LOC was secured. Accordingly,the Court will deny both motions.
